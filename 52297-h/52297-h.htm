<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a very comfortable faith to hold that “whatever
is, is best,” not only in the dispensations of
Providence, but in the social order of daily life;
but it is a faith which is perhaps best preserved
by careful avoidance of too much inquiry into
facts. The theory, if applied to past as well
as to present times, would involve us in some
startling contradictions, for there is hardly any
act, habit, or custom which has not been held
meritorious and commendable in one state of
society, and detestable and evil in some other.
If we believe that there are eternal principles of
right and wrong, wisdom and equity, far above
and greater than the “public opinion” of any one
age or country, we must acknowledge the absolute
obligation of inquiring, whenever matters of importance
are at stake, on what grounds the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
opinions rest, and how far they are the result of
habit, custom, and prejudice, or the real outgrowth
of deep convictions and beliefs inherent in the
most sacred recesses of human nature. While the
latter command ever our deepest reverence, as
the true “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi, vox Dei</span>,” nothing can be
more superficial, frivolous, and fallacious than the
former.</p>

<p>In a country where precedent has so much
weight as in England, it doubly behoves us to
make the distinction, and, while gratefully accepting
the safeguard offered against inconsiderate
and precipitate change, to beware that old custom
is not suffered permanently to hide from our eyes
any truth which may be struggling into the light.
I suppose that no thinking man will pretend that
the world has now reached the zenith of truth and
knowledge, and that no further upward progress
is possible; on the contrary, we must surely believe
that each year will bring with it its new
lesson; fresh lights will constantly be dawning
above the horizon, and perhaps still oftener discoveries
will be re-discovered, truths once acknowledged
but gradually obscured or forgotten will
emerge again into day, and a constantly recurring
duty will lie before every one who believes in life
as a responsible time of action, and not as a period
of mere vegetative existence, to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>“prove all things,
and hold fast that which is good.”</p>

<p>The above considerations arise naturally in connexion
with the subject of this paper, which is
too often set aside by the general public, who,
perhaps, hardly appreciate its scope, and are not
yet fully aroused to the importance of the questions
involved in the general issue. We are told so
often that nature and custom have alike decided
against the admission of women to the Medical
Profession, and that there is in such admission
something repugnant to the right order of things,
that when we see growing evidences of a different
opinion among a minority perhaps, but a minority
which already includes many of our most earnest
thinkers of both sexes, and increases daily, it
surely becomes a duty for all who do not, in the
quaint language of Sharpe, “have their thinking,
like their washing, done out,” to test these statements
by the above principles, and to see how far
their truth is supported by evidence.</p>

<p>In the first place, let us take the testimony of
Nature in the matter. If we go back to primeval
times, and try to imagine the first sickness or the
first injury suffered by humanity, does one instinctively
feel that it must have been the <em>man’s</em>
business to seek means of healing, to try the
virtues of various herbs, or to apply such rude
remedies as might occur to one unused to the
strange spectacle of human suffering? I think
that few would maintain that such ministration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
would come most naturally to the man, and be
instinctively avoided by the woman; indeed, I
fancy that the presumption would be rather in
the other direction. And what is such ministration
but the germ of the future profession of
medicine?</p>

<p>Nor, I think, would the inference be different
if we appealed to the actual daily experience of
domestic life. If a child falls down stairs, and is
more or less seriously hurt, is it the father or the
mother (where both are without medical training)
who is most equal to the emergency, and who
applies the needful remedies in the first instance?
Or again, in the heart of the country, where no
doctor is readily accessible, is it the squire and the
parson, or their respective wives, who are usually
consulted about the ailments of half the parish?
Of course it may be said that such practice is by
no means scientific, but merely empirical, and this
I readily allow; but that fact in no way affects
my argument that women are <em>naturally</em> inclined
and fitted for medical practice. And if this be so,
I do not know who has the right to say that they
shall not be allowed to make their work scientific
when they desire it, but shall be limited to merely
the mechanical details and wearisome routine of
nursing, while to men is reserved all intelligent
knowledge of disease, and all study of the laws by
which health may be preserved or restored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span></p>

<p>Again, imagine if you can that the world has
reached its present standing point, that society
exists as now in every respect but this,&mdash;that the
art of healing has never been conceived as a separate
profession, that no persons have been set apart
to receive special education for it, and that in fact
empirical “domestic medicine,” in the strictest
sense, is the only thing of the kind existing.
Suppose now that society suddenly awoke to the
great want so long unnoticed, that it was recognized
by all that a scientific knowledge of the
human frame in health and in disease, and a study
of the remedies of various kinds which might be
employed as curative agents, would greatly lessen
human suffering, and that it was therefore resolved
at once to set apart some persons who should
acquire such knowledge, and devote their lives to
using it for the benefit of the rest of the race. In
such case, would the natural idea be that members
of each sex should be so set apart for the benefit
of their own sex respectively,&mdash;that men should
fit themselves to minister to the maladies of men,
and women to those of women,&mdash;or that one sex
only should undertake the care of the health of
all, under all circumstances? For myself, I have
no hesitation in saying that the former seems to
me the <em>natural</em> course, and that to civilized society,
if unaccustomed to the idea, the proposal that
persons of one sex should in every case be consulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
about every disease incident to those of the
other, would be very repugnant; nay, that were
every other condition of society the same as now,
it would probably be held wholly inadmissable.
I maintain that not only is there nothing strange
or unnatural in the idea that women are the fit
physicians for women, and men for men; but on
the contrary, that it is only custom and habit
which blind society to the extreme strangeness
and incongruity of any other notion.</p>

<p>I am indeed far from pretending, as some have
done, that it is morally wrong for men to be the
medical attendants of women, and that grave
mischiefs are the frequent and natural results of
their being placed in that position. I believe
that these statements not only materially injure
the cause they profess to serve, but that they are
in themselves false. In my own experience as a
medical student, I have had far too much reason
to acknowledge the honour and delicacy of feeling
habitually shown by the gentlemen of the medical
profession, not to protest warmly against any such
injurious imputation. I am very sure that in the
vast majority of cases, the motives and conduct of
medical men in this respect are altogether above
question, and that every physician who is also a
gentleman is thoroughly able, when consulted by
a patient in any case whatever, to remember only
the human suffering brought before him and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
scientific bearing of its details; for as was said
not very long ago by a most eminent London
surgeon, “Whoever is not able, in the course of
practice, to put the idea of sex out of his mind, is
not fit for the medical profession at all.” It will,
however, occur to most people that the medical
man is only one of the parties concerned, and that
it is possible that a difficulty which may be of no
importance from his scientific standpoint, may yet
be very formidable indeed to the far more sensitive
and delicately organized feelings of his patient,
who has no such armour of proof as his own, and
whose very condition of suffering may entail an
even exaggerated condition of nervous susceptibility
on such points.<a name="Anchor_1" id="Anchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> At any rate, when we hear
so many assertions about natural instincts and
social propriety, I cannot but assert that their
evidence, such as it is, is wholly for, and not against,
the cause of women as physicians for their own sex.</p>

<p>If we take next the ground of custom, I think
the position of those who would oppose the medical
education of women is far less tenable than is
generally supposed; indeed, that a recent writer
stated no more than the truth when he asserted
that “the obloquy which attends innovation
belongs to the men who exclude women from a
profession in which they once had a recognised
place.”<a name="Anchor_2" id="Anchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> I believe that few people who have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
carefully considered the question from an historical
point of view have any idea of the amount of
evidence that may be brought to support this
view of the case.<a name="Anchor_3" id="Anchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a></p>

<p>Referring to the earliest classical times, we find
distinct mention in the <cite class="plain">Iliad</cite> of a woman skilled
in the science of medicine,<a name="Anchor_4" id="Anchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> and a similar reference
occurs also in the <cite class="plain">Odyssey</cite>.<a name="Anchor_5" id="Anchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> Euripides is no less
valuable a witness on this point. He describes
Queen Phædra<a name="Anchor_6" id="Anchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a> as disturbed in mind and out of
health, and represents the nurse as thus addressing
her: “If thy complaint be anything of the
more secret kind, here are women at hand to
compose the disease. But if thy distress is <em>such
as may be told to men</em>, tell it, that it may be
reported to the physicians;” thus indicating a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
prevailing public opinion that there were natural
and rigid limits to the medical attendance of men
and women, and that therefore some women were
specially trained to do what the regular physicians
must leave undone. It is at least remarkable to
find such evidence of general feeling on this matter
in a state of society supposed to possess much
less delicacy and refinement than our own.</p>

<p>We find records of several Grecian women who
were renowned for their medical skill, among
whom may be instanced Olympias of Thebes,
whose medical learning is said to be mentioned by
Pliny; and Aspasia, from whose writings on the
diseases of women, quotations are preserved in
the works of Aëtius, a Mesopotamian physician.<a name="Anchor_7" id="Anchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a>
On the authority of Hyginus rests the history of
Agnodice, the Athenian maiden whose skill and
success in medicine was the cause of the legal
opening of the medical profession to all the free-born
women of the State.<a name="Anchor_8" id="Anchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span></p>

<p>In more modern times, when almost all learning
was garnered into the religious houses, which
were not only the libraries but the hospitals of
the day, it seems evident that the care of the sick
and wounded fell at least as often to the share of
the Nunneries as of the Monasteries, and probably
medical skill, such as it was, found place among
the sisters quite as often as among the brethren
of the various religious Orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span></p>

<p>The old ballad of Sir Isumbras gives one illustration
out of many of the prevailing state of
things, relating how the nuns received the
wounded knight, and how</p>

<p>It may be remembered that Sir Walter Scott,<a name="Anchor_10" id="Anchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a>
after describing how Rebecca “proceeded, with
her own hands, to examine and bind up the
wounds,” goes on to remark, “The youngest
reader of romances and romantic ballads must
recollect how often the females, during the dark
ages, as they are called, were initiated into the
mysteries of surgery.... The Jews, both male
and female, possessed and practised the medical
science in all its branches.”</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century, when the Medical
School of Salerno enjoyed high reputation, we
find record of a female physician named Abella,
who lived there, and wrote in Latin various works
on medicine.<a name="Anchor_11" id="Anchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a></p>

<p>Early in the next century an Italian lady,
Dorotea Bocchi, was actually Professor of Medicine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
at the University of Bologna,<a name="Anchor_12" id="Anchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> and among
the traditions of the same University is preserved
the name of Alessandra Gigliani, who, in even
earlier times, was a learned student of anatomy.<a name="Anchor_13" id="Anchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a></p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, at Alcarez in Spain,
lived Olivia Sabuco de Nantes, who “had a large
knowledge of science and medicine,” and whose
medical works were printed at Madrid in 1588.<a name="Anchor_14" id="Anchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a></p>

<p>It is clear that in Great Britain at an early
period women were commonly found among the
irregular practitioners of medicine; and it is
equally clear that their male competitors greatly
desired to deprive them of the right to practise.
In 1421 a petition was presented to Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr>,
praying that “no woman use the practyse of fisyk
under payne of long emprisonment.”<a name="Anchor_15" id="Anchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a> Within a
few years after the first incorporation of the Colleges
of Physicians and Surgeons, an Act<a name="Anchor_16" id="Anchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> was passed
for the relief and protection of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>“Divers honest
psones, <em>as well men as women</em>, whom God hathe
endued with the knowledge of the nature, kind,
and operaçon of certeyne herbes, rotes, and waters,
and the using and ministering them to suche as
be payned with customable diseases, for neighbourhode
and Goddes sake, and of pitie and charytie,”
because the “Companie and Fellowship of Surgeons
of London, mynding onlie their owne lucres
and nothing the profit or ease of the diseased or
patient, have sued, vexed, and troubled,” the
aforesaid “honest psones,” who were henceforth
to be allowed “to practyse, use, and mynistre in
and to any outwarde sore, swelling, or disease, any
herbes, oyntements, bathes, pultes or emplasters,
according to their cooning experience and knowledge
... without sute, vexation, penaltie, or
losse of their goods.”<a name="Anchor_17" id="Anchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a></p>

<p>This provision clearly referred to general practice
other than that of midwifery, which latter
branch of the profession was then, as for centuries
both before and after, almost exclusively in the
hands of women. The very word <em>midwife</em>, with
its Latin synonym “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obstetrix</i>,” is sufficiently significant
on this point, for in neither language has
it any masculine equivalent, and the clumsy term
“Man-midwife” served, when first needed and
used, to mark the general sense of what the writer
in the <cite>Athenæum</cite> forcibly calls “masculine intrusion
into that which natural instinct assigns to
woman as her proper field of labour;” and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
same very suggestive title is the only one which
at the present day in legal phraseology distinguishes
the male practitioners of this branch of
medical art.</p>

<p>From the time of Moses onwards this part of
the profession has always been mainly in the
hands of women, and in many countries of Europe
no other usage has ever prevailed. The first
regular French medical society, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La confrairie de
St Cosme and St Damien</span>,” included within its
organization the Company of Midwives,<a name="Anchor_18" id="Anchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a> and from
that time down to the present it seems in France
to have been the custom to give to these women
a regular education, terminating in sufficient
examinations, an example which England would
have done well to follow.</p>

<p>In this country, however, midwives appear to
have held a most respectable position some centuries
ago, and a curious idea of their importance,
their duties, and their credit, may be gathered
from a <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> volume (without date) now preserved
in the British Museum,<a name="Anchor_19" id="Anchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a> which was evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
written at a time when hardly any but women
were employed in the “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">mysteries of the profession</span>,”
and when it was a comparatively rare thing,
that needed to be specially advised in certain
cases, for them to “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">make use of <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">(<i>i.e.</i>, call in)</span> a
physitien</span>.” The writer remarks that “it is meet
that the midwife be a woman well read and well
experienced,” and gives a caution that “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">drunkenness
is a sordid sin in any who use it, but is a
blemish worthy greater blame in ministers, magistrates,
midwives, physitiens, and chirurgeons</span>.”</p>

<p>Mrs Celleor, in her letter previously referred
to,<a name="Anchor_20" id="Anchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a> tells us that in 1642, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">the physitiens and
chirurgeons contending about it, midwifery was
adjudged a chirurgical operation, and midwives
were licensed at Chirurgeon’s Hall, but not till
they had passed three examinations before six
skilful midwives, and as many chirurgeon</span>s;” but
for some reason (connected probably with their
occasional baptismal functions) the midwives were,
in 1662, referred for their licence to Doctors’ Commons,
thus losing their official connexion with the
medical world.</p>

<p>How it came that English midwives fell gradually
from their high estate is partly explained by
a very public-spirited book (with the appropriate
motto “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non sibi sed aliis</span>”) written by a surgeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
in 1736.<a name="Anchor_21" id="Anchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a> The writer adverts to the accusations
of ignorance then brought against the midwives,
and remarks that “the only method by which
this fatal distemper can be cured, is to put it in
the power of midwomen to qualify themselves
thoroughly and at a moderate expense....
To which method of qualifying themselves I doubt
not the midwomen will object, and say that they
would readily be at any reasonable expense and
fatigue to be so thoroughly instructed, but it is
not in their power. The midwomen cannot, and
the midmen will not instruct them. The midmen
will object and say that the midwomen want both
capacity and strength (instruct them as ye please).
To which I reply (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ore rotundo, plenis buccis</i>) that
it is not want of capacity, docility, strength, or
activity ... which is evident to a demonstration
from the successful practice of women in the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel Die</span>u at Paris (the best school for midwifery
now in Europe).... Would not any person
then be deservedly laughed at who should assert
that our women are not as capable of performing
their office had they the same instruction as the
French women?” This chivalrous surgeon then
proposes that regular provision should be made for
proper instruction, and for examinations by two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
surgeons (who have lectured to the women), “and
six or seven other persons appointed by His
Majesty, because I don’t think it reasonable that
so many people’s bread should depend on the
humour or caprice of two men only;” adding
that “If some such scheme was put in execution,
I’m satisfied that in a very few years there would
not be an ignorant midwife in England, and consequently
the great agonies most women suffer at
the very sight of a man would be almost entirely
prevented,” and great expense and much life
saved.</p>

<p>However, we must suppose that these noble
words of protest fell upon deaf ears, and the midwives,
being left in their ignorance, their practice
gradually passed into the hands of the medical
men, who had every advantage of learning at
their command.<a name="Anchor_22" id="Anchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a></p>

<p>It is, however, only very recently that men-midwives
have been allowed to attend on royal
patients in this country; indeed, I believe that
the Princess Charlotte was the first to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
the precedent, and that our present Sovereign
was the first queen who followed it. In a very
interesting series of papers, by Dr Aveling, recently
published in the <cite>Lancet</cite>,<a name="Anchor_23" id="Anchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a> accounts have been
given of a number of the royal midwives whose
names have been honourably preserved in history,
such as Alice Dennis, who attended Anne of
Denmark, and received a fee of £100 “for her
pains and attendance upon the Queen, as of His
Highness’s free gift and reward, without account,
imprest, or other charge to be set on her for the
same.”</p>

<p>The same writer mentions that Margaret
Mercer was sent express from England in 1603
to attend on “His Majesty’s dearest daughter, the
Princess Electress Palatine.”</p>

<p>It is also recorded that “Mrs Labany attended
Mary of Modena, Queen of James <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, when she
was delivered, on June 10th, 1687, of James
Francis Edward, afterwards called the Pretender.”<a name="Anchor_24" id="Anchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a>
Mrs Wilkins, another midwife, seems also to have
been present on this occasion, and it is stated
that each of these persons received a fee of five
hundred guineas for her services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span></p>

<p>It is well known that Queen Charlotte was
always attended by a woman,<a name="Anchor_25" id="Anchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a> and the late
Duchess of Kent employed the Frau von Siebold,
of whom mention is made elsewhere.<a name="Anchor_26" id="Anchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a></p>

<p>Now that public attention is awaking to the
subject, and educated women are once more
desirous of undertaking this peculiarly womanly
work, we may indeed anticipate, with the already
quoted writer in the <cite>Athenæum</cite>, that a reactionary
movement will soon make itself felt, and that the
usage “which even up to the present time a large
proportion of our English families, especially those
of our northern towns and outlying country districts,
have never adopted, will most likely be
discontinued in all classes of English society
before the end of the present century.”</p>

<p>On the Continent of Europe, owing to their
better education, the midwives retain much of
the position that they have for a time lost in
England; and we hear that in Russia <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>“a medical
man is very rarely called in; notwithstanding,
fatal cases are of far less frequent occurrence in
Russia than in England;” and the same authority
tells us that ladies practising midwifery are
admitted into society as doctors would be, and
are well paid, both by the Government and by
private fees.<a name="Anchor_27" id="Anchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a></p>

<p>While thus briefly tracing out the history of
midwifery in modern times, and the causes which
led to its practice passing from the hands of
women into those of men, I have not paused to
mention, in due chronological order, those women
who, in the last three centuries, have been distinguished
for a knowledge of the other branches
of Medicine and Surgery. Of these I will now
enumerate a few, though my time and space are
far too limited either to give a complete list, or to
relate any but the most prominent particulars of
each case mentioned; but I can promise that any
one who will consult the authorities quoted will
be abundantly repaid by the long and interesting
details that I am forced to pass over in almost
every instance.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, in England, one of
the women most noted for medical skill was Lady
Ann Halket,<a name="Anchor_28" id="Anchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a> born in 1622, daughter of the then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
provost of Eton College. “Next to the study of
Divinity she seems to have taken most delight in
those of Physick and Surgery, in which she was
no mean proficient; nay, some of the best
physicians in the kingdom did not think themselves
slighted when persons of the greatest
quality did consult her in their distempers, even
when they attended them as their ordinary
physicians. Many from England, Holland, and
the remotest parts of the kingdom, have sent to
her for things of her preparing; and many whose
diseases have proved obstinate under all the
methods of physicians, have at length, by the
physicians’ own advice, been recommended and
sent to her care, and have been recovered by her.”</p>

<p>In 1644 was born Elizabeth Lawrence, afterwards
wife of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel Bury, of Bristol,
who wrote her life,<a name="Anchor_29" id="Anchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a> and who bears witness that
“it was not possible there should be a more
observant, tender, indulgent, and compassionate
wife than she was; a more sympathising spirit is
very rarely found.” He records that “she took
much pleasure in Anatomy and Medicine, being
led and prompted to it partly by her own ill
health, and partly with a desire of being useful.”
The difficulties that she encountered in her studies
may be guessed, since <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>“she would often regret
that so many learned men should be so uncharitable
to her sex, and be so loath to assist their
feebler faculties when they were anywise disposed
to an accurate search into things profitable
and curious. Especially as they would all so
readily own that souls were not distinguished by
sexes. And therefore she thought it would have
been an honourable pity in them to have offered
something in condescension to their capacities, rather
than have propagated a despair of their information
to future ages.” Her husband, however, tells
us that “she improved so much, that many of the
great masters of the Faculty have often been
startled by her stating the most nice and difficult
cases in such proper terms;” and, remarking that,
“How much knowledge and skill soever she
attained in the practice of Physick, by long
observation, conversation, and experience, yet
she was very distrustful of herself,” he adds
that the “instances of her successes in the
preservation of human lives were not easily
numbered.”</p>

<p>As a contemporary of these Englishwomen, we
find in Germany Elizabeth Keillen, who published
several medical works, and died in 1699. She is
said by Finauer to have had “great knowledge
of medicine and chemistry.”</p>

<p>In comparatively recent times, Bologna was
remarkable as ever for its liberal encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
of learned women, and about the middle of the
last century the Chair of Anatomy at that University
was filled by Anna Morandi Mazzolini,
whose exquisitely delicate anatomical models,
executed in wax, became the pride of the Museum
at Bologna. She first became interested in the
study of Anatomy in consequence of her wish to
help her husband, who was a distinguished anatomist,
and a maker of anatomical designs and
models. He fell into ill-health and mental despondency,
and therefore <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>“his wife, loving him
dearly, and fearing that he would desist from his
work, gave herself up to his comfort; and for this
purpose became herself an anatomical sculptor,
reading works of anatomy, consulting anatomical
tables and preparations, taking theoretical and
practical lessons from her husband, and, marvellous
to say, even dissecting dead bodies with resolute
mind, and with incredible perseverance.... Too
long to describe are the works executed in wax
by the able hands of this illustrious woman.
They were collected in five elegant cases in our
Anatomical Museum.... The fourth case encloses
delicate illustrations of all the parts belonging
to the senses of sight, smell, hearing, taste, and
touch&mdash;stupendous works in which she surpassed
herself, and also her husband, and his colleague,
Ercole Lelli.... These models were for some
time kept in her own house, and each one who saw
them spread her renown, so that through distant
countries was spread the fame of her works, so
that every learned and distinguished person
passing through Bologna was solicitous to visit
and know personally the maker of these wonders.”<a name="Anchor_30" id="Anchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a>
Signora Mazzolini also made original discoveries
in anatomical science, which obtained for her
many marks of distinction from the learned
colleges and societies of the day. She was offered
a Chair at Milan, with increased revenues, but
preferred to remain at Bologna, where she lived
till her death in 1774. Medici, in his records of
the Anatomical School of Bologna, speaks of this
lady with profound respect, as distinguished alike
by “rare powers, great erudition, gracious manners,
and delicate and gentle temperament,” and relates
that her fame reached the ears of the Emperor
Joseph <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, who visited her in 1769, and “having
seen her works and heard her conversation,”
loaded her with public honours. Her example
seems to have inspired others of her countrywomen
to follow in the steps of one so honoured, alike in
the stern duties of her profession, and in the
sanctities of household life; for in the course of
the next half century several Italian women availed
themselves of the thorough medical education
which the Italian Universities never refused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span></p>

<p>In 1788 Maria Petraccini<a name="Anchor_31" id="Anchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a> took a degree in medicine
at Florence, and we find her, a little later,
lecturing on anatomy at Ferrara, in presence of the
medical professors. She married Signor Feretti,
and has left several works on the physical education
of children.</p>

<p>Her daughter, Zaffira Feretti, seems to have
inherited her mother’s talents, for she studied
Surgery in the University of Bologna, and there
received a medical degree<a name="Anchor_32" id="Anchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a> in May 1800. She
obtained an appointment under the Italian Government,
and for some time lived in Ancona
acting as Director-General of the midwives in all
parts of the country. She afterwards went to
Turkey, and died at Patras in 1817.</p>

<p>Maria Mastellari seems also to have been a
woman of unusual talent, and “progressed diligently
in the most rigid sciences.” She obtained
a medical degree at Bologna in 1799. She subsequently
became the wife of Signor Collizoli-Sega,
and is described as possessing a “sweet and gentle
temperament, with special love of silence and
quiet. She centred her interests in her family,
which she managed admirably.”<a name="Anchor_33" id="Anchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a></p>

<p>Still more distinguished in the annals of medicine
was Maria delle Donne, who also studied in
the University of Bologna, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>“received the
doctoral laurel” in 1806.<a name="Anchor_34" id="Anchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a> She “constantly practised
both Medicine and Surgery,” and was
appointed by Napoleon Bonaparte to the Chair
of Midwifery at Bologna. The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gazette Medicale</cite>,
quoting from the “<cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Raccoglitore Medico</cite>,” gives
the following account of her:&mdash;“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anna Maria
delle Donne, docteur en médecine, auteur d’élégants
vers latins, professeur d’obstetrique, à l’Université
de Bologna, membre de l’Academie, bénédictine,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, est décedée le 9 Janvier, 1842. Cette
femme distinguée qui a succedé à Madame Mazzolini
et à Madame Bassi, est une des gloires
scientifiques de Bologna. Elle soutint en 1800,
avec un très grand succès, une thèse de Philosophie,
de Chirurgie, and de Medicine. Peu après, à la
suite d’un examen public, on lui conféra le grade
de docteur et de consultant. Napoleon en passant
à Bologne fut frappé du savoir de cette dame, et
institua pour elle une Chaire d’Obstetrique, où
elle se fit une grande renommée.</span>”<a name="Anchor_35" id="Anchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a></p>

<p>Nor was Italy alone noted as the birthplace of
women skilled in Medicine. In Germany, early
in this century, Frau von Siebold so greatly distinguished
herself in the practice of midwifery
that the degree of M.D. was conferred on her by
the University of Giessen;<a name="Anchor_36" id="Anchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a> and her daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
Marianne, afterwards Frau von Heidenreich,
studied in the Universities of both Göttingen and
Giessen, and took her degree in the regular way
in 1817. She is spoken of as “one of the most
famed and eminent female scholars of Germany,”
and as being “universally honoured as one of the
first living authorities in her special branch of
science.”<a name="Anchor_37" id="Anchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a> She died only in 1859.</p>

<p>In France, the name of Madame Lachapelle<a name="Anchor_38" id="Anchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a> was
known and honoured as that of one of the ablest
teachers of Midwifery during the latter part of
the last century. She has left several valuable
works on subjects connected with her specialty.
Her funeral in 1821 was followed by all the chief
physicians of Paris. Her pupil and successor,
Madame Boivin,<a name="Anchor_39" id="Anchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a> was still more distinguished for
her medical knowledge and skill, and for her
contributions to anatomical science. Her “<cite class="plain" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Memoire
de l’art des Accouchements</cite>” was approved
by the highest medical authority, and was appointed
as the text-book for students and midwives
by the Minister of the Interior. She was
invested with an Order of Merit by the King of
Prussia in 1814, and in the same year was appointed
co-director (with the Marquis de Belloy)
of the General Hospital for Seine and Oise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
in 1815 was entrusted with the direction of a
temporary Military Hospital, for her services in
which latter capacity she received a public vote
of thanks. She was also entrusted with the
direction of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hospice de la Maternité</span>, and of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison Royale de Santé</span>, and was one of the
most distinguished practitioners of the time.
She made original discoveries in Anatomy, invented
various surgical instruments, and obtained
prizes for medical theses from the Société de
Medicine.</p>

<p>Her medical writings were distinguished by
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">precision et clarté, jugement sain, erudition
choisie, et savoir solide</span>.” In 1846 one of her
books was eulogized by Jourdan as “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ouvrage
éminemment pratique, et le meilleur que nous
possedions encore sur ce sujet,” with the additional
remark that “tout se réunit pour lui mériter une
des premières places parmi les productions de la
littérature medicale moderne</span>.” She was a member
of the Medical Societies of Paris, Bordeaux,
Berlin, Brussels, and Bruges, and was honoured
with the degree of M.D. from the University of
Marbourg. She died in 1841.</p>

<p>These numerous instances of the successful
practice of Medicine by women seem to have been
little known, or else forgotten, to judge by the
surprise expressed when, after surmounting many
difficulties, an English lady, named Elizabeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
Blackwell, succeeded in obtaining medical education
and the degree of M.D. from a medical school
in America in 1849. The novelty, in truth, was
not in the granting of the medical degree to a
woman, but in its being received by an Englishwoman,
for it is hardly gratifying to one’s national
pride to find that England never has accorded
such encouragement to female learning as was
found in Italy, Germany, and France; and it is
still more painful to realize that this country,
almost alone, stands still aloof from the movement
of liberal wisdom that has now in all these lands,
as well as in Switzerland, and even in Russia,
granted to woman the advantage of University
education and degrees. English women are not
behind others in desiring knowledge, but as yet
they are forced to seek it on foreign shores, for
hitherto no British University has ever fully admitted
women to its educational advantages; and
a few years ago, that of London, with all its professions
of liberality, refused a woman’s petition
even for examination for the degree of M.D.!</p>

<p>So much for the historical evidence bearing on
this question. I am indeed sorry to have paused
so long on this part of the subject, but it seemed
essential to a proper statement of the whole case.</p>

<p>If, then, nature does not instinctively forbid
the practice of the healing art by women, and if
it cannot be denied that some at least of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
branches have long been in their hands, we must
go further to seek on what grounds their admission
to the medical profession should be opposed.</p>

<p>Probably the next argument will be that women
do not require, and are not fitted to receive, the
scientific education needful for a first-rate Physician,
and that “for their own sakes” it is not
desirable that they should pursue some of the
studies indispensably necessary. To this the
answer must be, that the wisest thinkers teach
us to believe that each human being must be “a
law unto himself,” and must decide what is and
what is not suitable for his needs, what will and
what will not contribute to his own development,
and fit him best to fulfil the life-work most congenial
to his tastes. If women claim that they
do need and can appreciate instruction in any or
all sciences, I do not know who has the right to
deny the assertion.</p>

<p>That this controversy is no new one may be
proved by reference to a very curious black-letter
volume now in the British Museum,<a name="Anchor_40" id="Anchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a> wherein the
writer protests, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">I mervayle gretely of the
opynyon of some men that say they wolde not
in no wyse that theyr doughters or wyves or
kynneswomen sholde lerne scyences, and that it
sholde apayre their cödycyons. This thing is not
to say ne to sustayne. That the woman apayreth
by connynge it is not well to beleve. As the
proverbe sayeth, ‘that nature gyveth maye not
be taken away.’</span>”</p>

<p>If it be argued that the study of Natural
Science may injure a woman’s character, I would
answer, in the words of one of the purest-minded
women I know, that “if a woman’s womanliness
is not deep enough in her nature to bear the
brunt of any needful education, it is not worth
guarding.” It is, I think, inconceivable that any
one who considers the study of natural science to
be but another word for earnest and reverent
inquiry into the works of God, and who believes
that, in David’s words, these are to be “sought
out of all them that have pleasure therein,” can
imagine that any such study can be otherwise
than elevating and helpful to the moral, as well
to the mental nature of every student who pursues
it in a right spirit. In the words of Scripture,
“To the pure, all things are pure,” and in
the phrase of chivalry, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honi soit qui mal y
pense.</span>”</p>

<p>It has always struck me as a curious inconsistency,
that while almost everybody applauds and
respects Miss Nightingale and her followers for
their brave disregard of conventionalities on behalf
of suffering humanity, and while hardly any one
would pretend that there was any want of feminine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>delicacy in their going among the foulest
sights and most painful scenes, to succour, not
their own sex, but the other, many people yet
profess to be shocked when other women desire to
fit themselves to take the medical care of those of
their sisters who would gladly welcome their aid.
Where is the real difference? If a woman is to
be applauded for facing the horrors of an army
hospital when she believes that she can there do
good work, why is she to be condemned as indelicate
when she professes her willingness to go
through an ordeal, certainly no greater, to obtain
the education necessary for a medical practitioner?
Surely work is in no way degraded by being made
scientific; it cannot be commendable to obey
instructions as a nurse when it would be unseemly
to learn the reasons for them as a student, or to
give them as a doctor; more especially as the
nurse’s duties may lead her, as they did in the
Crimea, to attend on men with injuries and
diseases of all kinds, whereas the woman who
practises as a physician would confine her practice
to women only. It is indeed hard to see any
reason of delicacy, at least, which can be adduced
in favour of women as nurses, and against them
as physicians.</p>

<p>Their natural capacity for the one sphere or
the other is, of course, a wholly different matter,
and is, indeed, a thing not to be argued about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
but to be tested.<a name="Anchor_41" id="Anchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a> If women fail to pass the required
examinations for the ordinary medical
degree, or if, after their entrance into practice,
they fail to succeed in it, the whole question is
naturally and finally disposed of. But that is not
the point now at issue.</p>

<p>That the most thorough and scientific medical
education need do no injury to any woman might
safely be prophesied, even if the experiment had
never been tried; but we have, moreover, the
absolute confirmation of experience on the point,
as I, for one, will gladly testify from personal acquaintance
in America with many women who
have made Medicine their profession; having had
myself the advantage of studying under one who
was characterized, by a medical gentleman known
throughout the professional world, as “one of the
best physicians in Boston,” and who, certainly,
was more remarkable for thorough refinement of
mind than most women I know,&mdash;Dr Lucy Sewall.</p>

<p>Of course there may always be unfortunate exceptions,
or rather there will always be those of
both sexes who, whatever their profession may be,
will be sure to disgrace it; but it is not of them
that I speak, nor is it by such individual cases that
the supporters of any great movement should
be judged.</p>

<p>The next argument usually advanced against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
the practice of medicine by women is that there
is no demand for it; that women, as a rule, have
little confidence in their own sex, and had rather
be attended by a man. That everybody had rather
be attended by a competent physician is no doubt
true; that women have hitherto had little experience
of competent physicians of their own sex
is equally true; nor can it be denied that the
education bestowed on most women is not one
likely to inspire much confidence. It is probably
a fact, that until lately there has been “no demand”
for women doctors, because it does not
occur to most people to demand what does not
exist; but that very many women have wished
that they could be medically attended by those of
their own sex I am very sure, and I know of more
than one case where ladies have habitually gone
through one confinement after another without
proper attendance, because the idea of employing
a man was so extremely repugnant to them. I
have indeed repeatedly found that even doctors,
not altogether favourable to the present movement,
allow that they consider men rather out of
place in midwifery practice;<a name="Anchor_42" id="Anchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a> and an eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
American practitioner once remarked to me that
he never entered a lady’s room to attend her in
confinement without wishing to apologize for what
he felt to be an intrusion, though a necessary and
beneficent intrusion, in one of his sex.</p>

<p>I suppose that the real test of “demand” is not
in the opinions expressed by those women who
have never even seen a thoroughly educated
female physician, but in the practice which flows
in to any such physician when her qualifications
are clearly satisfactory. In England there are at
present but two women legally qualified to practise
Medicine, and I understand that already their time
is much more fully occupied, and their receipts
much greater, than is usually the case with
medical men who have been practising for so
short a period. Dr Garrett Anderson’s Dispensary
for poor women is also largely attended,
and during the five years which have elapsed
since it was opened, more than 40,000 visits
have been made to it; 9000 new patients have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
been admitted, and 250 midwifery cases have
been attended by the midwives attached to the
charity, Dr Garrett Anderson being called in
when necessary.</p>

<p>When we turn to America, we find that a considerable
number of women have very extensive
practice and large professional incomes (more, indeed,
than in some cases seems warranted by their
medical qualifications). The Report of a little
hospital, managed entirely by women, in Boston,
U.S., relates that during 1867 the number of in-patients
was 198; of persons visited at their
homes, 281; and of those able to attend at the
dispensary, 4,576; all these patients being women
and children only. In fact, the attendance at the
Dispensary became so excessive in proportion to
the resources of the charity, that in 1868 a rule
was passed by the Committee requiring each
patient to pay twenty-five cents (or about ninepence)
for medicines, at each visit, except when
she brought “a certificate of her poverty, properly
authenticated.” This regulation brought out still
more strongly the distinct <em>choice</em> of poor women in
this matter, for, though the General City Dispensary
gave medicines gratuitously, the number of those
who attended at the Woman’s Hospital was much
less diminished than was expected, being still 3,236
in 1868. In New York also, where the Dispensary
managed by women doctors is but one of many,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
the crowd of patients is very great, the numbers
being, in 1867, no less than 6354, while 545
persons were attended at their homes either in
confinement or during severe illness. Of course
it will be understood that each patient thus
entered on the books implies not one visit, but
many, paid to the Dispensary, or often repeated
attendance at the patient’s home.</p>

<p>Of the Boston Hospital for Women and Children
I can speak from lengthened experience in it
as a student. When standing in its dispensary
I have over and over again heard rough women
of a very poor class say, when questioned why
they had not had earlier treatment for certain
diseases, “Oh, I <em>could not</em> go to a man with such
a trouble, and I did not know till just now that
ladies did this work;” and from others have
repeatedly heard different expressions of the feeling
that, “It’s so nice, isn’t it, to be able at last
to ask ladies about such things?”</p>

<p>As I am alluding to my own experience in this
matter, I may perhaps be allowed to say how often
in the same place I have been struck with the
<em>contingent</em> advantages attendant on the medical
care by women of women. How often I have seen
cases connected with stories of shame or sorrow to
which a woman’s hand could far most fittingly
minister, and where sisterly help and counsel
could give far more appropriate succour than could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
be expected from the average young medical man,
however good his intentions. Perhaps we shall
find the solution of some of our saddest social
problems when educated and pure-minded women
are brought more constantly in contact with their
sinning and suffering sisters, in other relations as
well as those of missionary effort.</p>

<p>So far from there being no demand for women
as physicians, I believe that there is at this
moment a large amount of work actually awaiting
them; that a large amount of suffering exists
among women which never comes under the notice
of medical men at all, and which will remain
unmitigated till women are ready in sufficient
numbers to attend medically to those of their
own sex who need them, and this in all parts of
the world. From India we hear urgent demands
for “educating native women of good caste, so as
to qualify them to treat female patients and
children.”<a name="Anchor_43" id="Anchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a> We are informed that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>“this is a
work which can only be carried on by women, as
the native women in many cases will rather die
than be seen by a man in times of sickness,”<a name="Anchor_44" id="Anchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a>
and arrangements have already been made for a
systematic “Female Medical Mission,” though
perhaps the standard of medical knowledge required
can, under existing circumstances, hardly
be fixed as high as is desirable. To show, however,
the eagerness with which the native women
avail themselves of the aid thus offered, I may
mention that when a lady (who had had some
medical training, but possessed no degree,) was
sent out by the Society<a name="Anchor_45" id="Anchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a> in December 1870, she,
during the first three months of her stay, had
occasion to pay no less than 313 professional visits
to zenanas, and to treat 158 patients at her
dispensary, which was arranged with a view to
affording them the utmost privacy. Subsequently
her visits to zenanas averaged as many as seventeen
a day, while nearly twice as many patients
came to her dispensary. Efforts are also being made
to train native Hindoo women for some branches,
at least, of the medical profession. Dr Corbyn of
Bareilly, in 1870, wrote as follows:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>“I am educating
a number of native girls, and three have
already passed as native doctors. They are of all
castes,&mdash;Christians, Mahommedans, and Hindoos.
My school is divided into three classes. The
first-class pupils can read and write English and
Urdee with accuracy. They are taught medicine,
surgery, midwifery, diseases of women and children
(especially the latter two). The second-class
learn anatomy, materia medica, and physiology, in
English and Urdee. The pupils of the other (preparatory)
class are taught English and Urdee.
We have a female ward attached to the dispensary
for women and children, and these girls entirely
attend to them, under my and the sub-assistants’
supervision. It is wonderful how they can manipulate;
they have plenty of nerve.”<a name="Anchor_46" id="Anchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a> Even more
recently we learn that “the Mahommedan Nawab
of Rampoor has presented to the Bareilly mission
a large building for the purpose of a medical school
for women. Several women are now going through
a scientific course of instruction.”<a name="Anchor_47" id="Anchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a></p>

<p>About eight or ten years ago, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>“several of the
wild tribes of Russian Asia petitioned the Government
to send them out properly qualified women
to act as midwives. Their petition was granted,
the Government undertaking all the expense of
the education and maintenance of a certain number
of women for this purpose. After a time one
of these tribes, the Kirgesen, petitioned further,
that the women thus sent to them should also be
taught some branches of the art of Medicine. One
of the women, then being trained as a midwife,
hearing of this petition, wrote to the Kirgesen,
proposing that she should study Medicine thoroughly,
and go out to them as a qualified doctor.
She suggested at the same time that they should
try to get permission for her to enter the Academy
of St Petersburg as a regular medical student.
The Kirgesen welcomed the proposal, and, through
an influential Russian general, obtained an official
document, empowering their future doctor to
attend the Academy as a student. They have
regularly sent money for her education and maintenance,
and from the first have taken the greatest
interest in her progress and welfare, requiring,
among other things, periodical bulletins of her
health. Hearing last summer that she was not
well, they sent money for her to go abroad for
her holiday, and asked for an extra bulletin.”<a name="Anchor_48" id="Anchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a></p>

<p>I cite the above facts to show that the demand
for female physicians is no artificial or imaginary
one, and that it does not spring out of any fanciful
whim of an over-refined social state; but lest
it should be supposed on the other hand to be
confined to half-barbarous nations, I may quote
the opinions expressed on this subject two years
ago in one of the most thoughtful of our English
journals: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>“We heartily admit that the only way
to discriminate clearly what practical careers
women are, and are not, fitted for, is to let them
try. In many cases, as in the medical profession,
we do not feel any doubt that they will find a
special kind of work for which they are specially
fitted, which has never been adequately done by
men at all, and which never would be done but
by women.... We have heard the opinion of
one of the most eminent of our living physicians,
that one of the new lady physicians is doing, in
the most admirable manner, a work which medical
men would never even have had the chance of
doing.”<a name="Anchor_49" id="Anchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a></p>

<p>I am told by Catholic friends that a great many
cases of special disease remain untreated in convents,
because the nuns, with their extreme
notions of feminine seclusion, think that it would
be little short of profanation to submit to some
kinds of medical treatment from a man.<a name="Anchor_50" id="Anchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a> Indeed,
it is expressly laid down by a great Catholic authority,
St Alphonsus,<a name="Anchor_51" id="Anchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a> that though monks and
nuns are required to place themselves in the
doctor’s care when commanded to do so by their
superiors, a special exception is to be made in the
case of nuns suffering from certain maladies, who
can only be required to accept treatment from a
skilled woman, if any such be available; as, under
existing circumstances, is so rarely the case. I do
not ask any reader to applaud or even justify these
poor nuns, if they, esteeming themselves “the
martyrs of holy purity,” sacrifice life to such
scruples; but I do most emphatically ask, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
name of humanity, whether the state of things can
be defended which may drive women, from the
highest and most holy motives, to submit to the
extremity of physical suffering and even death
itself, because it is impossible for them to obtain
the medical services of their own sex, and because
they believe they can best fulfil the spirit of their
vows by accepting no other?</p>

<p>I am informed by a friend that Archbishop
Manning, when expressing to her his strong interest
in the question of the medical education of
women, alluded to facts like those referred to
above, as affording one of the strongest motives
for such interest in the minds of Catholics. Nor,
surely, need sympathy in such a case be limited
within the bounds of any religious denomination.</p>

<p>To pass to the consideration of other cases of a
less exceptional kind, there can, I think, be little
doubt that an enormous amount of preventible
suffering arises from the unwillingness of very
many girls on the verge of womanhood to consult
a medical man on various points which are yet of
vital importance, and to appeal to him in cases of
apparently slight illness, which yet issue but too
often in ultimately confirmed ill-health. I firmly
believe that if a dozen competent women entered
upon medical practice at this moment in different
parts of England, they might, without withdrawing
a single patient from her present medical attendant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>find full and remunerative employment
in attending simply to those cases which, in the
present state of things, go without any adequate
treatment whatever; for I believe that many suffering
women would be willing to consult one of
their own sex, if thoroughly qualified, when they
refuse, except at some crisis of acute suffering, to
call in a medical man.<a name="Anchor_52" id="Anchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a> Probably Queen Isabella
of Castile<a name="Anchor_53" id="Anchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a> was neither the first nor the last woman
whose life was sacrificed to her modesty. Even
if such extreme instances are rare, I think it cannot
be denied that very much needless pain, “and
pain of a kind that ought not to be inflicted,” is
caused, especially to young girls, by the necessity
of consulting men on all occasions, and I believe
that those who know most of the facts insist most
strongly on this point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span></p>

<p>I do not know how far the Medical Profession
would acknowledge the truth of the above statement;
it is probable that they are really less
competent to judge about it than women are
themselves, for, as an eminent divine remarked
that it was considered a point of politeness not to
express theological doubts before a clergyman, it
may probably be thought still more obligatory not
to question the adequacy of the existing medical
profession before one of its members. One can
hardly imagine a lady sending for a doctor to tell
him why she will <em>not</em> consult him; it is sufficient
to know that many cases of disease among women
go without treatment; it is surely open to any one
at least to suggest the above as one of the possible
reasons.</p>

<p>And indeed, if no such special suffering were
often involved in the idea of consulting a man on
all points, it seems self-evident that a woman’s
most natural adviser would be one of her own
sex, who must surely be most able to understand
and sympathise with her in times of sickness
as well as of health, and who can often far more
fully appreciate her state, both of mind and
body, than any medical man would be likely
to do.<a name="Anchor_54" id="Anchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a></p>

<p>Nor can I leave the subject without expressing a
hope that, when women are once practising medicine
in large numbers, great gain may accrue to
medical science from the observations and discoveries
which their sex will give them double
facilities of making among other women. One of
the most eminent of the so-called “ladies’ doctors”
of the day writes:&mdash;“The principal reason why
the knowledge of diseases of women has so little
advanced, is the hitherto undisturbed belief that
one sex only is qualified by education and powers
of mind to investigate and to cure what the other
sex alone has to suffer.” After alluding to women
physicians of both ancient and modern times, Dr
Tilt further remarks, that, “if well educated, they
may greatly improve our knowledge of the diseases
of women.”<a name="Anchor_55" id="Anchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">[55]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, there is reason to hope that women
doctors may do even more for the health of
their own sex in the way of prevention than of
cure, and surely this is the very noblest province
of the true physician. Already it is being proved
with what eagerness women will attend lectures
on physiology and hygiene when delivered to
them by a woman, though perhaps not one in ten
would go to the same course of lectures if given by
a medical man. I look forward to the day when
a competent knowledge of these subjects shall be
as general among women as it now is rare; and
when that day arrives, I trust that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>“poor
health” which is now so sadly common in our sex,
and which so frequently comes from sheer ignorance
of sanitary laws, will become rather the exception
than, as now too often, the rule. I hope that then
we shall find far fewer instances of life-long illness
entailed on herself by a girl’s thoughtless ignorance;
I believe we shall see a generation of women
far fitter in mind and body to take their share in
the work of the world, and that the Registrar will
have to record a much lower rate of infantile mortality
when mothers themselves have learned to
know something at least of the elementary laws
of health. It has been well said that the noblest
end of education is to make the educator no longer
necessary; and I, at least, shall think it the highest
proof of success if women doctors can in time succeed
in so raising the standard of health among
their sister women, that but half the present percentage
of medical practitioners are required in
comparison to the female population.</p>

<p>Of course I do not expect that every reader
will look at this question from my point of
view, or will be able to arrive at the same conclusions
respecting it. But I think that many who
have never before seen the matter in the light
in which I have tried to place it, will be ready
to admit that there are at any rate <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primâ facie</i>
grounds for my argument, and that allowing even
for considerable over-statement on my part, there
may still remain subject for serious consideration.</p>

<p>Even if I am wholly mistaken, and if all that
needs doing <em>can</em> in England be effectually done
by men, we have still, I think, no reason for the
exclusion of women from the medical profession;&mdash;there
is still no ground on which it can be
right to refuse to every patient the power of election
between a physician of her own sex and of
the other, when women as well as men are
desirous of qualifying themselves for this work,
seeing that it will after all be always a matter of
choice; for we cannot suppose that the time will
ever come when women will be arbitrarily prevented
from employing men, as they now are
arbitrarily prevented from employing women, as
their medical attendants.</p>

<p>The assertion that women <em>are</em> at present
“arbitrarily prevented from employing women as
their medical attendants” may sound startling,
but it is at this moment practically true in England,
in the most literal sense. Since medical
practice has, for the protection of the public, been
made a matter of legislation, it has been absolutely
illegal for any physician or surgeon to
practise as such in this country, unless registered
by the appointed Medical Board, and that Board
is not obliged to register any one who has not
a British medical degree. It is evident, then,
that to deny all British medical degrees to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
women,&mdash;not only to refuse them instruction,
but to refuse to examine them if they have
acquired knowledge elsewhere,&mdash;<em>is</em> most arbitrarily
to prohibit all women, whatever their
qualification, from practising medicine in the
United Kingdom, except under legal pains and
penalties.</p>

<p>Of course no such arbitrary action was even
contemplated when the Act of 1858 was passed;
and I think that when once the great practical
injustice of the present state of things is fully
understood by the public, a change is inevitable,&mdash;either
British medical degrees will be thrown
open to women, as is most desirable, or the legal
conditions of practice will be modified to meet
the case of those to whom such degrees are
denied. It is perhaps hardly to be expected,
though very much to be desired, that medical
men as a body should themselves take the initiative
in this matter, and throw open the doors to
all women who desire worthily to join their
fellowship, for it proverbially “needs <em>very</em> good
men to give up their own monopoly;” but the
action of the general public in the matter can
hardly be doubtful except as a question of time;&mdash;no
English court could be expected to condemn
to legal penalties a succession of highly-educated
ladies who may have seized, often with great
effort, every opportunity open to them to fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
themselves thoroughly for a work which they believe
to be especially their own.</p>

<p>The recent action taken in the matter by the
authorities at Apothecaries’ Hall is exactly of the
kind to outrage an Englishman’s sense of fairness,
and therefore is sure before long to bring its own
redress. As the facts may not be thoroughly
understood in the non-medical world, I will briefly
recapitulate them. When Miss Garrett first
began to study medicine in 1860, she tried to
obtain admittance to one School and University
after another, and finally found that Apothecaries’
Hall was the only body which, from its charter,
had no power to refuse to examine any candidate
complying with its conditions. She accordingly
went through the required five years’ apprenticeship,
and obtained her diploma in 1865, having
gone to very great additional expense in obtaining
privately the required lectures by recognised
Professors,&mdash;sometimes paying fifty guineas for
a course when the usual fee, in the classes from
which she was debarred, was but three or four.
Not content, however, with indirectly imposing
this enormous pecuniary tax on women, the authorities
now bethought them to pass a rule forbidding
students to receive any part of their medical
education privately,&mdash;this course being publicly
advised by one of the leading medical journals as
a safe way of evading the obligations of the charter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
and yet effectually shutting out the one chance
left to the women!<a name="Anchor_56" id="Anchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56.">[56]</a></p>

<p>Of course the efficacy of this measure ceases the
moment that any regular medical school fairly
opens its doors to women; but till that day comes,
it presents a formidable, if not insuperable, difficulty.
Commenting on this proceeding, the <cite>Daily
News</cite> remarks:&mdash;“We recommend these facts to
the good people who think that coercion, restriction,
and the tyranny of combination, are peculiar
to any one class of society. It will be a great day
in England when the right of every individual to
make the most of the ability which God has given
him, free from interested interference, is recognised,
and to that goal we are surely advancing;
but our progress is slow, and it is very clear that it
is not only in the lower ranks of the community
that the obstructive trades-union spirit is energetically
operating.”</p>

<p>While such is the state of affairs in England,
other European nations have taken a very different
position. We have already seen that the Italian
Universities were, in fact, never closed to women,
and that at Bologna no less than three women
held Professors’ chairs in the Medical Faculty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span><a name="Anchor_57" id="Anchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a>
We have several instances of degrees granted to
women in the Middle Ages by the Universities of
Bologna, Padua, Milan, Pavia, and others; the
earliest instance that I have found being that of
Betisia Gozzadini,<a name="Anchor_58" id="Anchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">[58]</a> who was made Doctor of Laws
by the University of Bologna in 1209. In Germany
also several such instances have occurred.
At Paris no less than seven degrees in Arts and
Sciences have been granted to women by the University
of France within the last ten years, and a
number of women are now studying in the Medical
School there. In answer to my enquiries in
1868, the Secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction
made the following communication:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<p class="address_date">“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Paris, le 18 Août 1868<span class="spread-out_date">,</span><br />

<p>“Il est bien entendu que vous devez être munie, par voie

<p>“Agreez, Mademoiselle l’assurance de mon respect,</p>

<p class="signed">(<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Signed</span>)<span class="spread-out">&nbsp;</span>“<span class="smcap">Danton</span>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this Essay was first published, two women
have obtained the degree of M.D. in Paris, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
passing brilliant examinations in each case. The
first graduate was our distinguished countrywoman,
Miss Garrett, who, after passing the five
examinations required, received her degree in
June 1870. The <cite>Lancet</cite> records that “her friends
must have been highly gratified to hear how her
judges congratulated her on her success, and to
see what sympathy and respect was shown to her
by all present.”<a name="Anchor_59" id="Anchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a></p>

<p>The next lady who graduated was Miss Mary
C. Putnam of New York, who, after quietly pursuing
her studies (combined with original researches),
like a second Archimedes, during both
the sieges of Paris in 1870&ndash;71, took her degree
with great honour in August 1871. The <cite>Lancet</cite><a name="Anchor_60" id="Anchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60.">[60]</a>
remarked&mdash;“Miss Putnam has just been undergoing
the very strict examinations for the doctor’s
degree in Paris, and has passed very creditably.
This is the second case in the Paris faculty, the
innovation being made quietly, whilst elsewhere
angry discussions intervene.”</p>

<p>At Lyons, also, two women have obtained degrees
in Arts, in 1861 and 1869 respectively. At
Montpellier a degree in Arts was also conferred on
a woman in 1865, and another lady has passed the
first two examinations in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ecole de Pharmacie
Supérieure</i> in that city.</p>

<p>For several years past the University of Zurich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
has been thrown open to women as freely as to
men; a Russian woman, named Nadejda Suslowa,
being the first to obtain a degree in Medicine, in
1867. Several more have since then graduated,
and others are at present pursuing their studies
there in the ordinary classes.<a name="Anchor_61" id="Anchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a></p>

<p>In March 1870 it was announced, on the authority
of the <cite>Lancet</cite>, that the University of
Vienna had formally decided to admit women as
students, and to confer on them the ordinary
medical degrees.<a name="Anchor_62" id="Anchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62.">[62]</a></p>

<p>A month or two later the Swedish newspapers
published in their official columns a royal decree,
granting to Swedish women the right to study
and practise medicine, and ordaining that the
professors of the Universities should make arrangements
for teaching and examining them in
the usual way.<a name="Anchor_63" id="Anchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a></p>

<p>Even Russia seems in advance of England in
this matter. In 1869, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>“the Medico-Chirurgical
Academy of St Petersburg conferred the degree
of M.D. upon Madame Kaschewarow, the first
female candidate for this honour. When her
name was mentioned by the Dean, it was received
with an immense storm of applause, which lasted
for several minutes. The ceremony of investing
her with the insignia of her dignity being over,
her fellow-students and colleagues lifted her upon
a chair, and carried her with triumphant shouts
through the hall.”<a name="Anchor_64" id="Anchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">[64]</a></p>

<p>At Moscow, also, “the Faculty of Medicine,
with the full concurrence of the Council of the
University of Moscow, have decided to grant to
women the right of being present at the educational
courses and lectures of the Faculty, and to
follow all the labours of the Medico-Chirurgical
Academy. The tests of capacity will be precisely
the same as for male students.”<a name="Anchor_65" id="Anchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65.">[65]</a> Still more recently
we hear from St Petersburg that “the
success of the lady physicians is encouraging other
ladies to devote themselves to medicine, and a
considerable step has been made in this direction.
... A person who interests herself in the
higher education of women has requested the
Minister of State to accept the sum of £8000, and
to devote it to the establishment of medical
classes for women at the Imperial Academy of
Medicine.”<a name="Anchor_66" id="Anchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66.">[66]</a></p>

<p>Nor is the progress of liberality less marked on
the other side of the Atlantic. It is well known
that several of the smaller medical schools in the
United States admitted women as soon as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
applied for instruction, but until 1869 no American
University threw open its doors. About the
end of that year, however, the State University
of Michigan took the initiative in this matter, and
the following statement was inserted in last year’s
official Calendar:&mdash;“Recognising the equality of
rights of both sexes to the highest educational
advantages, the Board of Regents have made provision
for the medical education of women, by
authorising a course of education for them, separate,
but in all respects equal to that heretofore
given to men only. The conditions of admission,
as well as graduation, are the same for all.” During
the first year fourteen women appeared as
students in the Faculty of Arts, three in that of
Law, and thirteen were studying Medicine and
Surgery. In the spring of 1871 Miss Sanford
received the first medical degree granted to a
woman by an American University; and it is
worth notice that this lady (herself a pupil of Dr
Lucy Sewall of Boston,) took her place among the
most distinguished graduates of the year;&mdash;her
thesis on “Puerperal Eclampsia” being the one
selected by the Medical Faculty for publication.
The number of women studying at Michigan University
during the session 1871&ndash;72 was sixty-eight,
as compared with the thirty of the previous
year; such rapid increase being tolerably significant
of the avidity with which women embrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
the long-denied opportunities of instruction, and
offering sufficient encouragement to any British
University that may resolve to try the same experiment.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that many nations have,
from the earliest period, recognised and acted
upon the truth that “Mind is of no sex,” and that,
where this has not been the case in former times,
the barriers are being rapidly and readily thrown
down as civilization advances, till, in truth, Great
Britain now stands almost alone in refusing to
admit her daughters to the national universities,
and in denying them the opportunity of proving
experimentally whether “the male mind of the
Caucasian race<a name="Anchor_67" id="Anchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a>” is indeed so immeasurably superior
to its feminine counterpart. It may be remarked,
by the bye, that it is very curious to
notice how the very people who loudly maintain
the existence of this vast mental disparity are just
those who strenuously resist every endeavour to
submit their theory to the touchstone of experience,
instead of welcoming the application of
those tests that might be expected so triumphantly
to prove their point! But, jesting apart,
the present state of things can hardly be agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
to English self-respect; and it is to be hoped that
our country will soon descend from her bad eminence,
and no longer be marked out as the one
land where men only can reap benefit from the
educational advantages provided at the expense
of the nation at large. It can hardly be an object
of ambition to the learned men of any people to
deserve the woe pronounced of old against those
who “have taken away the key of knowledge, and
them that were entering in, they hindered.”</p>

<p>There seems to be practically no doubt now
that women are and will be doctors. The only
question really remaining is, how thoroughly they
are to be educated and fitted to take their share
of responsibility in the care of the life and health
of the nation; how far their difficulties are to be
lightened or increased; and whether the state of
things shall continue by which they are driven
into unwilling quackery on the one hand, or made
to suffer real oppression from irresponsible authority
on the other.</p>

<p>Men who, after an irregular education and
incomplete training, claim the name of physicians,
are justly stigmatised as quacks, and excluded
from honourable fellowship, for they have refused
the straight and direct path as too laborious, and
have sought admittance by crooked ways. It is
right enough to impose heavy penalties on them
for practising without a diploma which it needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
only industry on their part to obtain; but what
shall we say when women are refused admission
to every regular Medical School, and then, when
they have perhaps painfully and laboriously
gathered their own education, either in England
or abroad, are excluded from the fellowship of the
profession, for the sin of having been unjustly
treated! That some women have succeeded in
acquiring most competent medical knowledge and
skill can hardly be denied, except by those who
really know nothing of the facts, or are wilfully
blind to them; but in almost every case they
have done so at a cost of money, effort, and personal
sacrifice, that can be expected only from the
few. Imagine all medical students met by the
difficulties which female students must encounter;&mdash;how
many properly educated doctors should we
have?</p>

<p>Many persons, however, who would gladly see
women engage in the practice of Medicine, yet
think it undesirable that they should obtain their
education in the same schools as men; and here
another practical point arises for consideration.
If it is indeed true that no one is fit for the profession
of Medicine unless able to banish from its
practice the personal idea of sex, it certainly
seems as if all earnest students seeking the same
knowledge for the same ends, ought to be able to
pursue their studies together. We are constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
told (and I think rightly) that no woman <em>need</em>
object, when necessary, to consult a medical man
on any point, because the physician will see in it
simply an impersonal “case,” and will, from his
scientific standpoint, practically ignore all that
would be embarrassing as between persons of
opposite sexes. If this is and ought to be true,
it does not seem too much to demand equal delicacy
of feeling among those who will in a year or
two be themselves physicians; and, from personal
experience when studying in large American hospitals
with students of both sexes, I believe that
no serious difficulty need ever occur, except in
cases of really exceptional coarseness of character
on one side or the other. That such joint
study will be for the first few days novel and
embarrassing is of course natural; but I believe
that, as the first novelty wears off, the embarrassment
too will disappear in the interest of a common
study, and that no thoroughly pure-minded
woman, with an ordinary amount of tact, need
ever fear such association with students of whom
the majority will always be gentlemen. It is of
course a radically different thing to study any or all
subjects with earnest scientific interest, and to
discuss them lightly in common conversation.<a name="Anchor_68" id="Anchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">[68]</a></p>

<p>Not only in America has the system of joint
education been tried, but at Paris and at Zurich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
ladies are at the present moment studying in the
regular Medical Schools, and friends at each place
assure me of the complete success of the experiment,
if such it is considered. Dr Mary Putnam
(the first lady ever admitted to the Parisian
Medical School) in 1869 wrote thus: “There is
not the slightest restriction on my studies or my
presence at the Classes.... I have never found
the slightest difficulty in studying with the young
men with whom I am associated, not only at lectures,
but in the hospitals, reading-room, laboratory,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> I have always been treated with a
courtesy at once frank and respectful.” A lady
studying Medicine at the University of Michigan
in 1870, wrote&mdash;“We are very much pleased
with the way in which we have been received
here, both by professors and students; they have
treated us in every respect with great courtesy.”
Another lady, when studying at Zurich, reported
that “in the Medical School of Zurich, no advantage
which is afforded to the male students is
denied to the women. Every class is open to
them, and they work side by side with the men.
The students have invariably been to me most
friendly, helpful, and courteous.” In answer to
an official letter of enquiry, the Dean of the
Medical Faculty at Zurich wrote: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>“Since 1867,
ladies have been regularly admitted as matriculated
students, and have been allowed all the
privileges of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cives academici</i>. As far as our
experience has gone, the new practice has not in
any way been found to damage the interests of
the University. The lady students we have
hitherto had have all been found to behave with
great good taste, and to be diligent students.”
Such evidence must surely carry more weight
than the opinions of those who merely theorize
about probabilities, especially when such theorists
start, as is often the case, with a predisposition to
find “lions in the way.”</p>

<p>If the admission of women to the regular Medical
Schools has been proved to bring no evil
consequences, wherever teachers and professors
have shown good will, it needs strong arguments
to justify their exclusion from advantages which
they can hardly obtain elsewhere; for it has been
well remarked, that nothing can be more false
than to confound a “small injustice” with “injustice
to a small number.”</p>

<p>It is simply a mockery, and one calculated to mislead
the public, when a medical journal<a name="Anchor_69" id="Anchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a> announces
that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>“We would offer no obstacle to any steps
which women may think would be conducive to
their own benefit. But if it be indispensable that
they should study Anatomy and Medicine, let
them, in the interests of common decency, have
an educational institution and licensing body of
their own.” And again, “If women are determined
to become Medical Practitioners, they are
at perfect liberty to do so; but it is only consistent
with decency that they should have their
own special Schools and examining bodies.” Such
writers know perfectly well that it is utterly
impossible for two or three struggling women
students to found “their own special Schools,”
(though, when a sufficient number of women are
educated, they may gladly make such provision for
those who will succeed them,) and that, if in truth
women as well as men have a right to claim
opportunities of education, the duty of providing
separate instruction for them clearly falls on the
existing Schools, if the authorities refuse to admit
them to share in the general advantages offered.</p>

<p>For myself, I cannot see why difficulties that
have in France and Switzerland been proved
chimerical, should in England be supposed (without
any fair trial) to be insurmountable; as I, for
one, cannot believe that less good and gentlemanly
feeling should be expected from English and
Scotch students, wherever their Professors set
them an example of courtesy, than is found among
the undergraduates of foreign Universities.</p>

<p>But this is a point which I do not greatly care
to urge; although Medical Science can undoubtedly
be most favourably studied under those conditions
which only large institutions can command,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
and which could for many years be but imperfectly
attained in a Medical College designed for
women only. Still there is no doubt that women,
thoroughly in earnest, and with a certain amount
of means at their command, <em>can</em> obtain adequate
medical instruction without entering any of the
existing Schools for men, and no doubt arrangements
could be made to secure all that is necessary
with much less effort and expense than at
present. We should be very thankful to have
the Medical Schools thrown open to us, to be allowed
some share in the noble provision made,
chiefly with public money, for the instruction of
medical students; but this is not absolutely indispensable;
we may be refused this, and yet gain
our end, though with greater toil and at greater
expense. As time goes on, and as the number of
women attracted by the study of Medicine increases,
it will probably, apart from all extrinsic
considerations, be both natural and convenient
that they should have a Medical School of their
own, in which every means of study should be
specially provided for, and adapted to, their needs.
It is not, however, I think, desirable that this
should be done until the number of students is
sufficient to guarantee funds for the liberal payment
of first-rate teachers, and the ample provision
of all needful facilities. If no women are to
be made competent physicians till they have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
school of their own, there never will be any at
all; for those who broadly oppose the movement
will always be able to say, “Women have never
proved that they can use such advantages as will
be thus furnished; do not establish a College for
them till they have.”</p>

<p>So the double argument would run thus: “Do
not found a Female Medical School till we are sure
that women can successfully study Medicine; do
not let any woman study Medicine except in a
Medical School of their own.” Between such a
Scylla and Charybdis who can steer clear?</p>

<p>Supposing, however, that this dilemma were
escaped, and that adequate means of instruction
were provided, (with men, or apart from them, I
care not,) it would still, I think, be essential, not
only to the interests of women doctors, but to those
of the public at large, that the standard for medical
practitioners of both sexes should be identical;
that women should be admitted to the examinations
already established for men, and should receive
their medical degree on exactly the same
terms. I do not for a moment desire to see
degrees granted to women by a College of their
own, or to see a special examination instituted for
them; for there would be extreme difficulty in
measuring the exact value of any such diplomas,
and danger would arise, on the one hand, of injustice
being done to those thoroughly competent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
but possessing “only a woman’s degree,” and, on
the other, of the standard being really lowered,
and the medical degree coming to possess an uncertain
and inferior value.</p>

<p>Of this latter danger we have abundant warning
in America, where every fresh College is
allowed the right of “graduating” its own students
on whatever terms it pleases, and where, indeed,
one is confounded by the innumerable diplomas
granted by all sorts of Colleges to all sorts of
people, so that one has need to inquire whether
the M.D. attached to a name represents a degree
granted by some “Eclectic” or “Hygeio-therapeutic”
College of mushroom growth, or by the
Universities of Harvard and Yale.</p>

<p>We cannot wish for such a state of things in
England. Let British degrees continue to be of
perfectly definite value; make the conditions as
stringent as you please, but let them be such as
are attainable by all students, and are clearly understood
by the general public; and then, for all
that would worthily win and wear the desired
honours, “a fair field and no favour.”</p>

<p>Is there not one of the English, Scotch, or Irish
Universities that will win future laurels by now
taking the lead generously, and announcing its
willingness to cease, at least, its policy of arbitrary
exclusion? Let the authorities, if they please,
admit women to study in the ordinary classes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
with or without any special restrictions (and it is
hard to believe that at least the greater part of
the lectures could not be attended in common);
or let them, if they think needful, bid the women
make their own arrangements, and gather their
knowledge as they can;<a name="Anchor_70" id="Anchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">[70]</a> with this promise only,
that, when acquired, such knowledge shall be duly
tested, and, if found worthy, shall receive the
Hall-mark of the regular Medical Degree.</p>

<p>Surely this is not too much to ask, and no more
is absolutely essential. If, indeed, the assertions
so often made about the incapacity of women are
true, the result of such examinations (which may
be both theoretical and practical, scientific and
clinical,) will triumphantly prove the point. If
the examinations are left in the hands of competent
men, we may be very sure that all unqualified
women will be summarily rejected, as indeed
it is to be desired that they should be.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span></p>
<p>If, on the contrary, some women, however few,
can, under all existing disadvantages, successfully
pass the ordeal, and go forth with the full authority
of the degree of Doctor of Medicine, surely
all will be glad to welcome their perhaps unexpected
success, and bid every such woman, as
she sets forth on her mission of healing, a hearty
God-speed!</p>

gratifying therefore to find that a field of activity which has been
recently claimed for the sex ... finds a precedent in the venerable

   I subjoin as a curiosity the quaint version of this story that
is given in a letter from Mrs Celleor (a fashionable midwife of the
reign of James <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>), published in 1687, and now to be found in
the British Museum. After saying that “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Among the subtile
Athenians a law at one time forbade women to study or practise
medicine or physick on pain of death, which law continued some
time, during which many women perished, both in child-bearing
and by private diseases, their modesty not permitting them to
admit of men either to deliver or cure them,</span>” she continues,
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Till God stirred up the spirit of Agnodice, a noble maid, to pity
the miserable condition of her own sex, and hazard her life to
help them; which to enable herself to do, she apparelled her like
a man, and became the scholar of Hierophilos, the most learned
physician of the time; and having learned the art, she found out
a woman that had long languished under private diseases, and
made proffer of her service to cure her, which the sick person
refused, thinking her to be a man; but, when Agnodice discovered
that she was a maid, the woman committed herself into her hands,
who cured her perfectly; and after her many others, with the
like skill and industry, so that in a short time she became the
successful and beloved physician of the whole sex.</span>” When her
sex became known to the public, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">she was like to be condemned
to death for transgressing the law ... which, coming to the ears
of the noble women, they ran before the Areopagites, and the
house being encompassed by most women of the city, the ladies
entered before the judges, and told them they would no longer
account them for husbands and friends, but for cruel enemies that
condemned her to death who restored to them their health, protesting
they would all die with her if she were put to death....
This caused the magistrates to disannul the law, and make another,
which gave gentlewomen leave to study and practise all parts of
physick to their own sex, giving large stipends to those that did
it well and carefully. And there were many noble women who
studied that practice, and taught it publicly in their schools as
long as Athens flourished in learning.</span>”

   A curious coincidence recently occurred which may illustrate
this feeling. Not long ago I was attacked in the newspapers for
having alluded to this subject, and a certain doctor published
three letters in one week to prove that “ninety-nine out of every
hundred Englishwomen suffering from female diseases freely consulted
medical men.” During that very week no less than three
women, in different classes of society, appealed to me for advice
and treatment for sufferings about which they “did not like to
ask a gentleman.” In each case I advised them to consult a medical
man, as I was not yet myself in practice, and there were no
women doctors in Edinburgh; but in each case I found that their
feeling in the matter was too strong to allow them to do so.

   It would have been perfectly easy in Edinburgh, during
1871&ndash;72, to make complete arrangements for instruction, partly
inside and partly outside the walls of the University, if only the
authorities would have authorised the lady students to organize
the necessary classes for themselves at their own expense. But
the obstructive party took refuge behind the traditional non-possumus,
and could not be driven from their position, though the
Lord Advocate of Scotland gave a distinct opinion to the effect
that any needful arrangements might legally be made, and though
the more far-sighted Professors strongly deprecated such an abnegation
of University power for the purpose of subserving a merely
temporary object. In point of fact, the whole history of this
struggle is one long illustration of the good old proverb,&mdash;“Where
there’s a will, there’s a way.”

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Starting</span>, then, with the assumption that women
may, with profit to themselves and to the community,
become practitioners of medicine, it is
clear that they must, in the first place, secure such
an education as shall make them thoroughly competent
to take their share of responsibility in the
care of the national health; and, secondly, that
they must obtain this education in accordance
with the regulations prescribed by authority, so
that they may be recognised by the State as having
conformed to all its legal requirements, and
may practise on terms of perfect equality with
other qualified practitioners.</p>

<p>It is essential to the thorough comprehension
of this last point that the laws regulating medical
practice in this country should be clearly understood,
as these can never be lost sight of by those
who are engaged in the battle which we are now
waging, and I will, before proceeding further, endeavour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>to state clearly the provisions of the
Medical Act of 1858. For the protection of the
public against ignorant and mischievous quacks,
the Act provided that no person should be recognised
as a legally-qualified practitioner of medicine
in the United Kingdom unless registered in
a Register appointed to be kept for that purpose.
The Act provided that all persons possessing the
degree of M.D. from any foreign or colonial University,
and already practising in this country at
the date of the passing of the Act, should be entitled
to be so registered; but that, with this
exception, (and a curious one in favour of those
on whom the doctorate had been conferred by the
Archbishop of Canterbury,) no medical practitioners
could demand registration unless holding
a licence, diploma, or degree, granted by one of
the British Examining Boards specified in the
schedule attached to the Act. It is, of course,
self-evident that these provisions were intended
solely to defend the public against incompetent
practitioners, and, though it is perhaps to be
regretted that the Act did not expressly require
the Medical Council to examine, and, on proof of
competency, to register the holders of foreign
diplomas, and all others who had pursued a regular
course of medical study, it could not be anticipated
that any great injustice would be done by
the omission of any such a clause; and still less,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
assuredly, was it intended by this Act to secure
to one sex a monopoly of all medical practice.
But, at the present moment, it is certain that
great danger exists that the Act may be wrested
from its original purpose and made an almost insurmountable
barrier to the admission of women
to the authorised practice of medicine; and this
because the Act, as it at present stands, makes it
obligatory on all candidates to comply with certain
conditions, and yet leaves it in the power of
the Medical Schools, collectively, arbitrarily to
preclude women from such compliance.</p>

<p>The following clauses of the Act of 1858 will
show the absolute necessity that now exists for the
registration of all practitioners of respectability:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... “After January 1, 1859, the words ‘legally qualified
Medical Practitioner,’ or ‘duly qualified Medical Practitioner,’
or any words importing a Person recognised by Law
as a Medical Practitioner or Member of the Medical Profession,
when used in any Act of Parliament, shall be construed
to mean a Person registered under this Act....</p>

<p>“After January 1, 1859, no Person shall be entitled to
recover any Charge in any Court of Law for any Medical or
Surgical Advice, Attendance, or for the Performance of any
Operation, or for any Medicine which he shall have both prescribed
and supplied, unless he shall prove upon the Trial
that he is registered under this Act....</p>

<p>“After January 1, 1859, no Certificate required by any
Act now in force, or that may hereafter be passed, from any
Physician, Surgeon, Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery, or
other Medical Practitioner, shall be valid unless the Person
signing the same be registered under this Act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span></p>

<p>“Any Person who shall wilfully and falsely pretend to be,
or take or use the Name or Title of a Physician, Doctor of
Medicine, Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery, ... or any
Name, Title, Addition, or Description implying that he is
registered under this Act, or that he is recognised by Law as a
Physician, or Surgeon, ... shall, upon a summary Conviction
for any such offence, pay a sum not exceeding Twenty Pounds.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It is, then, sufficiently plain that any doctor
practising in this country without the required
registration, not only places himself in the position
of a quack and a charlatan, but actually
incurs legal penalties for assuming medical titles,
however fairly they may have been won in the
most eminent of foreign universities. It is therefore
clear that it becomes a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ non</i> that
any women, desiring to practise medicine in this
country, should obtain their education in such a
way as will entitle them to demand registration.</p>

<p>There are at this moment two Englishwomen
whose names appear on the Register as legally
qualified medical practitioners; and it may be
necessary for me now to explain how they came
respectively to attain this position, and how it
happens that no more women are able to avail
themselves of the means that were open to them.</p>

<p>Though several English ladies are recorded in
history as having studied medical science, I am
not aware that any of our country-women ever
graduated in medicine before the year 1849, when
Miss Elizabeth Blackwell, after surmounting many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
difficulties, obtained the degree of M.D. from a
college in the State of New York. Returning
subsequently to England, she took advantage of
the clause in the Act of 1858, which I have
already mentioned, and demanded and obtained
registration in the British Register. But the
clause referred to was, as I have explained, retrospective
only, and no one can now obtain an
American degree, and in virtue of it claim registration
in this country.</p>

<p>This being the case, when, in the year 1860,
Miss Garrett resolved to begin the study of medicine,
with a view to practising in England, it was
necessary that she should obtain her education
under the auspices of some one of the medical
corporations empowered to give registrable qualifications.
After trying in vain to obtain admission
to one School and College after another, she
finally found entrance at Apothecaries’ Hall, which
was, from its charter, taken, as I suppose, in conjunction
with the provisions of the Apothecaries’
Act of 1815,<a name="Anchor_71" id="Anchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a> incapable of refusing to examine any
candidate who complied with its conditions of study.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span></p>
<p>In order to observe the regulations of Apothecaries’
Hall, she was obliged to attend the lectures
of certain specified teachers; and though she was,
in some cases, admitted to the ordinary classes,<a name="Anchor_72" id="Anchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a>
in others she was compelled to pay very heavy
fees for separate and private tuition by the recognised
lecturers. She had also considerable difficulty
in obtaining adequate hospital teaching,
though there was, in truth, hardly the slightest
difference between the advantages she needed and
those now habitually accorded to lady probationers
and trained nurses, who are constantly present
with the ordinary students at the bedside and in
the operating theatre.<a name="Anchor_73" id="Anchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a> She obtained admission,
however, to the Middlesex Hospital, and might,
I suppose, have studied there as long as she
pleased, had she not been unfortunate enough to
acquit herself too well in some of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivâ-voce</i>
examinations in which she took part with the
male students, thus arousing their manly wrath,
which showed itself in a request that she should
be required to leave the Hospital,<a name="Anchor_74" id="Anchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a> and this noble
and magnanimous application was actually granted!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
She, however, completed her studies elsewhere,
and especially at the London Hospital; being, it
is to be presumed, too discreet to enter again on
the field of competition. Thus, at length, she
obtained her education, and, in 1865, received the
licence to practise from Apothecaries’ Hall, which
enabled her to place her name upon the British
Register. But no sooner had she thus demonstrated
the existence of at least a postern gate by
which women might enter the profession, than the
authorities took alarm, and, with the express
object of preventing other women from following
so terrible a precedent, a rule was passed, forbidding
students henceforth to receive any part of
their education privately, it being well known
that women would be rigorously excluded from
some at least of the public classes!</p>

<p>As, then, the different doors by which the two
ladies above-mentioned entered the profession of
medicine were both closed after them, it is evident
that, when, three years ago, I looked round
for the means of obtaining medical education in
this country, it was necessary that some new way
should be devised. It is true that in several of
the European Universities women were at that
moment studying medicine;&mdash;indeed, I am not
aware that any of the Italian,<a name="Anchor_75" id="Anchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a> French, or German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
Universities have ever been closed against women
who applied for admission. I might, no doubt, have
obtained, at the world-renowned <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ecole de Médicine</i>
in Paris, a medical education at least equal,
and, in some respects, probably superior, to anything
that this country affords; and at the University
of Zurich, also, a considerable number of
women have, for some years, been receiving an
excellent medical education. But it seemed to
me radically unjust, and most discreditable to
Great Britain, that all her daughters who desired
a University education should be driven abroad
to seek it; only a small number of women could
be expected thus to expatriate themselves, and
those who did so would have to incur the great
additional difficulty and disadvantage of studying
all the departments of medical science in a foreign
language, and under teachers whose experience
had been acquired in a different climate and
under different social conditions from our own.
And even if these difficulties could be overcome,
another objection appeared to me absolutely insuperable.
The Act of 1858 distinctly declares
that only British licenses, diplomas, and degrees
can now claim registration, and that without
registration no practitioner can be considered as
legally qualified. It is well known with what
distinguished honour Miss Garrett lately passed
her examinations in Paris, and with what brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
success she gained one of the most valuable medical
degrees in Europe, and yet in the official
British Register her name appears only and solely
as that of a licentiate of Apothecaries’ Hall. As
no such license was now open to me and to other
women, it was clear that those of us who went
abroad for education might expect, after years of
severe labour, to return to England to be refused
official recognition on the Register, and, in fact,
in the eye of the law, to hold a position exactly
analogous to that of the most ignorant quack or
herbalist who might open a penny stall for the
sale of worthless nostrums. As such a position
was hardly to my taste, it became necessary to
try other means.</p>

<p>It seemed to me highly desirable that, if women
studied medicine at all, they should at once aim
at what is supposed to be a high standard of education,
and that, to avoid the possibility of cavil
at their attainments, they should forthwith aspire
to the medical degree of a British University.</p>

<p>I first applied to the University of London, of
whose liberality one hears so much, and was told
by the Registrar that the present Charter had
been purposely so worded as to exclude the possibility
of examining women for medical degrees,
and that under that Charter nothing whatever
could be done in their favour. Knowing that at
Oxford and Cambridge the whole question was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
complicated with regulations respecting residence,
while, indeed, neither of these Universities furnished
a complete medical education, my thoughts
naturally turned to Scotland, to which so much
credit is always given for its enlightened views
respecting education, and where the Universities
boast of their freedom from ecclesiastical and other
trammels. In March 1869, therefore, I made my
first application to the University of Edinburgh,
and I hope in the following pages to give a rapid
sketch of the chief events of the subsequent three
years in connexion with that University, though
time and space oblige me to make the sketch so
brief that I must ask the reader’s indulgence if, in
some points, it is less plain and distinct than it
might be if I could enter more fully into
details.</p>

<p>For the sake of clearness, let me first explain,
in few words, who constitute the different bodies
that take a share in the government of Edinburgh
University, taken in the order in which my application
was considered by them. The Medical
Faculty of course consists of Medical Professors
only; the Senatus comprises all the Professors of
every Faculty, and also the Principal; the University
Court is composed of eight members only;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span><a name="Anchor_76" id="Anchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a>
and lastly, the General Council of the University
consists of all those graduates of Edinburgh who
have registered their names as members. Each
of these bodies had to be consulted, as also the
Chancellor, before any important change could be
made.</p>

<p>When I first went to Edinburgh, I found many
most kind and liberal friends among the Professors.
In the Medical Faculty itself, Sir James
Simpson, Professor Hughes Bennett, and Professor
Balfour, Dean of the Medical Faculty, at
once espoused my cause; and I need not say that
Professor Masson and other members of the non-medical
Faculties were not a whit behind in kindness
and help. I found, on the other hand, a few
determined enemies who would listen to nothing
I could urge on the ground of either justice or
mercy, and one or two who seemed to think that
the fact of a woman’s wishing to study medicine
at all quite exempted them from the necessity of
treating her even with ordinary courtesy. The
majority, however, occupied a somewhat neutral
position;&mdash;they did not wish arbitrarily to stretch
their power to exclude women from education,
and yet they were alarmed at what seemed to
them the magnitude and novelty of the change
proposed.</p>

<p>Several Professors were especially timid about
the question of matriculation, and argued that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
till they had some evidence of probable success, it
would be premature to let women matriculate,
since, by so doing, they would acquire rights and
privileges of the most extensive kind. To meet
this difficulty I gladly accepted a suggestion made
to me privately by the Dean of the Medical
Faculty, that I should, for the present, waive the
question of matriculation, and should, during the
summer months, attend his class in Botany and
that of Professor Allman in Natural History, to
see whether, as the <cite>Spectator</cite> expressed it, “Scotch
and English students were really so much more
brutal than Frenchmen and Germans,” or whether
a lady could, without discomfort, attend the ordinary
classes. This plan met with much approval,
and some of the Professors’ wives most kindly
offered to accompany me to the classes when the
time should come. The Medical Faculty and
Senatus successively sanctioned this tentative
plan, and, after a short stay in Edinburgh, I left
for England to make preparations for returning to
spend the summer session as arranged.</p>

<p>But two or three hostile Professors appealed to
the University Court; some of the students also
sent up a memorial against the arrangement proposed,
and the question was reconsidered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am anxious, as far as possible, to avoid personalities
in this matter, and yet, I think, I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
properly tell my story without explaining at the
outset that, in my opinion at least, the whole
opposition to the medical education of women has
in Edinburgh, been dictated by one man and his
immediate followers. It is hardly necessary to say
that that man is Sir Robert Christison,<a name="Anchor_77" id="Anchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a> whose great
age and long tenure of office naturally give him unusual
weight, both in the University and among
the medical men of Edinburgh. Having said this,
I need only remark further that Professor Christison
has, ever since I came to Edinburgh, been
the only professor and the only medical man who
has had a seat in the University Court, and also
the only person who has all along been a member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
of every body, without exception, by whom our
interests have had to be decided, viz., of the
Medical Faculty, the Senatus, the University
Court, the University Council, and the Infirmary
Board.</p>

<p>The question then was brought before the
University Court in April 1869. The meetings
of the Court are held in strict privacy, (against
which the public and the members of the University
Council have often protested,) and I can
only state the result of their deliberation. On
April 19th the following resolution was passed:&mdash;“The
Court, considering the difficulties at present
standing in the way of carrying out the resolution
of the Senatus, as a temporary arrangement in
the interest of one lady, and not being prepared
to adjudicate finally on the question whether
women should be educated, in the medical classes
of the University, sustain the appeals, and recall
the resolution of the Senatus.”</p>

<p>The very palpable invitation to other ladies to
come forward, which appeared on the face of this
resolution, bore fruit; for, in the course of the
next month, or two, four more ladies expressed
their wish to be admitted as students, and certain
of the University authorities held out hopes
that an application for <em>separate</em> classes would be
successful. Accordingly, in June 1869, I addressed
a letter to the Rector of the University,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
who is also President of the University Court,
enquiring whether the Court would “remove
their present veto in case arrangements can be
made for the instruction of women in separate
classes; and whether, in that case, women will
be allowed to matriculate in the usual way, and
to undergo the ordinary Examination, with a
view to obtain medical degrees in due course?”</p>

<p>I also wrote to the Senatus asking them to
recommend the matriculation of women as medical
students, on the understanding that separate
classes should be formed; and, moreover, addressed
a letter to the Dean of the Medical Faculty, offering,
on behalf of my fellow-students and myself,
to guarantee whatever minimum fee the Faculty
might fix as remuneration for these separate classes.</p>

<p>On July 1st, 1869, at a meeting of the Medical
Faculty of the University, it was resolved to recommend
to the Senatus:&mdash;</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Senatus Academicus, July<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
2, 1869, the Report of the Medical Faculty was
read, agreed to, and ordered to be transmitted
to the University Court. At a meeting of the
University Court, on 23d July 1869, “Mr Gordon,
on behalf of the Committee appointed at last
meeting to consider what course should be followed
in order to give effect to the resolution of
the Senatus, reported that the Committee were
of opinion that the matter should be proceeded
with under section <abbr title="12">xii.</abbr> 2, of the Universities Act,
as an improvement in the internal arrangements
of the University. Mr Gordon then moved the
following resolution, which was adopted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Court entertain an opinion favourable to the resolutions
of the Medical Faculty in regard to the matriculation of
ladies as medical students, and direct these resolutions to be
laid before the General Council of the University for their consideration
at next meeting.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This resolution was approved by the General
Council on October 29th, 1869, and was sanctioned
by the Chancellor on November 12th, 1869. The
following regulations were officially issued at the
same date, and inserted in the Calendar of the
University:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1.) Women shall be admitted to the study of medicine in
the University; (2.) The instruction of women for the profession
of medicine shall be conducted in separate classes, confined
entirely to women; (3.) The Professors of the Faculty
of Medicine shall, for this purpose, be permitted to have separate
classes for women; (4.) Women, not intending to study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
medicine professionally, may be admitted to such of these
classes, or to such part of the course of instruction given in
such classes, as the University Court may from time to time
think fit and approve; (5.) The fee for the full course of instruction
in such classes shall be four guineas; but in the
event of the number of students proposing to attend any such
class being too small to provide a reasonable remuneration at
that rate, it shall be in the power of the professor to make
arrangements for a higher fee, subject to the usual sanction of
the University Court; (6.) All women attending such classes
shall be subject to all the regulations now or at any future
time in force in the University as to the matriculation of
students, their attendance on classes, Examination, or otherwise;
(7.) The above regulations shall take effect as from the
commencement of session 1869&ndash;70.<a name="Anchor_78" id="Anchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>In accordance with, the above resolutions, four
other ladies and myself were, in October 1869,
admitted provisionally to the usual preliminary
examination in Arts, prescribed for medical
students entering the University. Having duly
passed, and received certificates to that effect from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
the Dean of the Medical Faculty, we, after the
issue of the regulations above cited, all matriculated
in the ordinary manner at the office of the
Secretary of the University. We paid the usual
fee, inscribed our names in the University album,
with the usual particulars, including the Faculty
in which we proposed to study, and received the
ordinary matriculation tickets, which bore our
names, and declared us to be “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cives Academiæ
Edinensis</i>.” We were at the same time registered
in due course as students of medicine, by the
Registrar of the Branch Council for Scotland, in
the Government register kept by order of the
General Council of Medical Education and Registration
of the United Kingdom, such registration
being obligatory on all medical students, and
affording the sole legal record of the date at which
they have commenced their studies.</p>

<p>It seemed now as if smooth water had at length
been reached, after seven months of almost incessant
struggle. The temporary scheme first
suggested had been set aside, but its place had
been taken by one much more comprehensive,
which had resulted from five months of consideration
and consultation, and which had ultimately
received the sanction of every one of the University
authorities in succession. Not only were
women allowed the privilege of matriculation
which we had been told involved so much; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
formal regulations, entitled “For the Education
of Women in Medicine in the University,” had
been framed, and have now for three years formed
an integral part of the University Calendar.</p>

<p>For six months our hopes seemed realised.
We pursued most interesting courses of study in
the University, and found nothing but kindness
at the hands of our teachers, and courtesy from
the male students, whenever we happened to
meet them in the quadrangle or on the staircases.
Even Dr Christison was reported to have said in
Senatus that, as the experiment was to be tried,
he for one would co-operate to give it a fair trial.</p>

<p>Though the lectures were delivered at different
hours, the instruction given to us and to the
male students was identical, and, when the class
examinations took place, we received and answered
the same papers at the same hour and on identical
conditions, having been told that marks would be
awarded indifferently to “both sections of the
class,”&mdash;this latter expression being, by the bye,
repeatedly used during the course of the term by
both the Professors who instructed us.</p>

<p>I am obliged now to mention the results which
appeared in the prize-lists, not with a view to
claim any special credit for the ladies,<a name="Anchor_79" id="Anchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a> (whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
efforts to obtain education might well make them
more zealous than most of the ordinary students,)
but because I believe that the facts I am about to
mention had a real and immediate connexion with
subsequent events.<a name="Anchor_80" id="Anchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a></p>

<p>In the class of Physiology there had been 127
male students, of whom 25 appeared in the honours
list; in the Chemistry class there were 226 male
students, of whom 31 obtained honours; of the
5 women, 4 were in honours in both classes. One
of the ladies obtained the third place in the
Chemistry prize-list; and, as the two gentlemen
above her had already gone through a course of
lectures on the same subject, Miss Pechey was
actually first of her year. In the College calendar
it was stated that “the four students who have
received the highest marks <em>are entitled</em> to have
the Hope Scholarships,”&mdash;such scholarships giving
free admission to the College laboratory, and having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>been founded by the late Professor Hope from
the proceeds of lectures given to ladies some fifty
years previously.<a name="Anchor_81" id="Anchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a></p>

<p>It had occurred to us that if any lady won this
scholarship she might be debarred from making
full use of it as regards the laboratory, in consequence
of the prohibition against mixed classes,
but as it had been distinctly ordained that we
were to be subject to “all the regulations in force
in the University as to examinations,” it had <em>not</em>
occurred to us as possible that the very name
of Hope Scholar could be wrested from the successful
candidate and given over her head to the
fifth student on the list, who had the good fortune
to be a man.<a name="Anchor_82" id="Anchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">[82]</a></p>

<p>But this was actually done.</p>

<p>At the same time that the Professor announced
to us his intention of withholding the Hope
Scholarship from the student who had won it, on
the ground that, having studied at a different
hour, she was not a member of <em>The Chemistry Class</em>,
though he, at the same time, gave her a bronze
medal of the University, (to which I should think
her claim must have been neither greater nor less,
since these medals were given to the five students<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
highest on the list,) he offered us written certificates
of having attended a “ladies’ class in the
University,” as of course he saw that to give the
ordinary certificates of attendance on “<em>The</em> Chemistry
Class of the University” would be to
destroy his own argument with reference to the
Scholarship. As, however, such certificates were
absolutely worthless to us as students of medicine,
we declined them, and appealed to the Senatus to
ordain that the ordinary certificates should be
granted to us, as they alone would qualify for
professional examination. At the same time Miss
Pechey made an appeal to have the Hope Scholarship
awarded to her in due course. It is hardly
credible that (by very narrow majorities in each
case) the Senatus decided that we were to have
exactly the ordinary certificates, which declared
us to have attended <em>the Chemistry Class</em> of the
University of Edinburgh, and yet acquiesced in
Miss Pechey’s being deprived of her Scholarship on
the ground that she was not a member of that class!</p>

<p>I do not wish to dwell longer on these incidents,
but I have narrated them here because I believe
that the above mentioned results of the class
examinations aroused in our opponents a conviction
that the so-called experiment was not going
to fail of itself, as they had confidently hoped, but
that if it was to be suppressed at all, vigorous
measures must be taken for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span></p>

<p>At the previous meeting of the University
Council, no Professor had stood up to oppose the
admission of women, though Dr Andrew Wood
had covered himself with glory by protesting that
he had too many sons to provide for, to acquiesce
in the education of women for the Medical Profession!<a name="Anchor_83" id="Anchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a>
At the next meeting, however, of the
Council, in April 1870, Professor Masson moved
that, in view of the success that had hitherto attended
the ladies’ studies, the existing regulations
should be so far relaxed as to allow of the attendance
of women in the ordinary classes, where no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
special reasons existed to the contrary, that they
might be spared the additional expense, inconvenience,
and difficulty, attendant on the formation
of separate classes in every subject. Professor
Balfour, Dean of the Medical Faculty, seconded
this motion, and expressed his opinion that arrangements
might easily be made to carry it out.
Professors Laycock and Christison, however, opposed
it vigorously, and that in speeches of such
a character that the <cite>Times</cite><a name="Anchor_84" id="Anchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a> remarked in a leading
article:&mdash;“We cannot sufficiently express the indignation
with which we read such language, and
we must say that it is the strongest argument
against the admission of young ladies to the Edinburgh
medical classes that they would attend the
lectures of Professors capable of talking in this
strain.”<a name="Anchor_85" id="Anchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a> When the vote was taken, the motion
in our favour was lost by forty-seven votes to
fifty-eight, and no change was therefore made in
the University regulations.</p>

<p>The Professor of Botany kindly made arrangements
for giving to us and other ladies a separate
course of lectures, though he much regretted
to be forced to this double, and needless, expenditure
of time and trouble. Dr Allman,
the Professor of Natural History, who had in
the previous summer consented to my entering
his ordinary class, stated that his health would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
not allow him to undertake the labour of two
classes, and, therefore, he could not teach us.
We then made application for instruction to
Dr Alleyne Nicholson, the extra-mural teacher
of the same subject, and he at once agreed to
our request. Before making any arrangements,
he spoke to the members of his class at their first
meeting, and, mentioning our application, he enquired
whether they would unite with him in
inviting us to join their class. This they unanimously
did; and, as we had no objection to offer,
the first “mixed class” was inaugurated, and
continued throughout the summer without the
slightest inconvenience.<a name="Anchor_86" id="Anchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">[86]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span></p>
<p>In the meantime, we were anxious to make arrangements
for the next winter session, and it
was especially necessary that a course of instruction
in Anatomy should be provided, as the subject
was one of the greatest importance, and the
University professor flatly refused either to instruct
us himself or allow his assistant to do so in
any way whatever. Under these circumstances
we endeavoured to obtain a competent extra-mural
teacher who should form a special class for
our instruction; but I was repeatedly warned
that, by this time, the medical prejudice had been
so strongly aroused against us, and the medical
influence was so strongly at work, that we should
fail in our endeavours, as no young medical man
dare run the risk of being ostracised for giving us
help. The only extra-mural teacher of Anatomy
who was already recognised by the University
was Dr Handyside, who was one of a band of nine
associated lecturers who conjointly rented a building,
called Surgeons’ Hall, for their lectures.
Some of these lecturers were indignant at the way
in which we were treated in the University, and,
in July 1870, they, by a majority, passed the following
resolutions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. That it is expedient that lecturers in this Medical School
should be free to lecture to female as well as to male
students.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span></p>

<p>2. That no restrictions be imposed on the lecturers as to
the manner in which instruction is to be imparted to
women.<a name="Anchor_87" id="Anchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>After the passing of this regulation, we applied
to Dr Handyside to know if he could make arrangements
for giving us a separate class. He
replied that it would be quite impossible for him
to do so consistently with his duty to his other
students, but that if we liked to attend his course
of Anatomy in the ordinary way, he should be
happy to receive us. Dr Heron Watson similarly
consented to admit us, to his ordinary course of
Lectures on Surgery, and so our arrangements
for winter lectures were complete.</p>

<p>The class of Practical Anatomy always meets at
the beginning of October, although the lectures
do not commence till the following month. The
more studious and industrious students usually
come up at the earlier date, but those who care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
less about their work seldom appear till November,
as that is the beginning of the compulsory
session. All through October we studied under Dr
Handyside with great comfort; the students who
worked with us, though in another part of the room,
were never uncivil, and in fact we hardly exchanged
a dozen sentences with any of them during the
month. Dr Handyside and his demonstrator both
told us that they had never seen so much steady,
earnest work as since we joined the class, and expressed
their opinion that the results were quite as
valuable for the male students as for our ourselves.
With November 1st the lectures began, and
everything went on satisfactorily for another ten
days.</p>

<p>About this time, acting on the advice of a
medical friend, we made an application for permission
to study in the wards of the Royal Infirmary,
and, somewhat to our surprise, were met by
a curt refusal. As we knew that several of the
managers were liberal-minded and just men, we
felt sure that they could not have fully understood
the importance to us of the concession we desired,
and, on enquiry, I found this was the case. One
of those who had voted against our admission confessed
to me that he had, in so doing, been guided
simply by the medical members of the Board, and
that he was not even aware that we were matriculated
students of the University, and that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
could not complete our education without attending
the Infirmary, as there was no other hospital
in Edinburgh of the size prescribed for “qualifying
instruction.” We, therefore, drew up a memorial
stating our grounds of application, and
another was also sent in by our two teachers, Dr
Watson and Dr Handyside, urging on the Board
the great injustice that would be done by our
exclusion. We also obtained and sent in a written
paper from three of the medical officers of the
Infirmary, promising to give us all needful instruction
if we were admitted.<a name="Anchor_88" id="Anchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a> When these
documents were presented to the managers, a
majority of those present were in favour of our
immediate admission, but, on the ground of want
of notice, our opponents got the matter deferred
for a week. From that time the behaviour of the
students changed. It is not for me to say what
means were used, or what strings were pulled;
but I know that the result was, that instead of
being, as heretofore, silent and inoffensive, a certain
proportion of the students with whom we
worked became markedly offensive and insolent,
and took every opportunity of practising the
petty annoyances that occur to thoroughly ill-bred
lads,&mdash;such as shutting doors in our faces,
ostentatiously crowding into the seats we usually
occupied, bursting into horse-laughs and howls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
when we approached, as if a coalition had been
formed to make our position as uncomfortable as
might be. At the same time a students’ petition
against our admission to the Infirmary was
handed about, and 500 signatures were obtained,
though, if some of the reports I heard were true,
but a very small number out of the 500 had
even read the petition before signing it. Be this
as it may, the petition was got ready for the adjourned
meeting, and when that came, every opponent
we had among the managers was at his
place, while some of our friends were unavoidably
absent, and the Lord Provost, being in the chair,
was precluded from voting, so that the medical
party gained an easy victory. But when I say the
medical party, I ought to explain that three
medical men voted on our side,&mdash;a point on which
I shall have to say something subsequently.</p>

<p>The students were naturally elated at finding
so much attention paid to their petition,<a name="Anchor_89" id="Anchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a> especially
as I was told that some of the medical Professors
had warmly applauded them for their
exertions, and I suppose the lowest section among
them began to wonder whether, if they had succeeded
in keeping us out of the Infirmary, they
might not, by a little extra brutality, drive us
away from the lecture-room. Two days later,
came the second competitive examination of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
term, and on this day occurred the riot, when the
gates were shut in our faces by a mob,<a name="Anchor_90" id="Anchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a> who stood
within, smoking and passing about bottles of
whiskey, while they abused us in the foulest possible
language. It would be difficult to speak in
too strong terms of the conduct of those engaged
in this outrage, or of those who were morally
responsible for it; but I am glad to say a word
to-day about a part of the story which has not
been made sufficiently public,&mdash;viz., the conduct
of those of the students whose indignation against
the rioters was even deeper than our own.<a name="Anchor_91" id="Anchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a> One
gentleman rushed down from Surgeons’ Hall, and,
at great risk to himself, forced open the gates for
our admission, and a number of others made their
way in after us to see that we came to no harm.
When the class, which was interrupted throughout
by the clamour outside, was over, Dr Handyside
asked me if we would withdraw through a
back door, but I said that I thought there were
quite enough gentlemen in the class to protect
us; and so it proved. As I spoke, a number
came around us and formed a regular body-guard
in front, behind, and on each side, and, encompassed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>by them, we passed through the still
howling crowd at the gate, and reached home
with no other injuries than those inflicted on our
dresses by the mud hurled at us by our chivalrous
foes. Nor was this all. When we arrived at the
College next day, at the same hour, we found
quite a formidable array of gentlemen with big
sticks in their hands, who were keeping back a
rabble that looked greatly disgusted, but merely
vented their spite in remarkably bad language as
the gentlemen referred to raised their hats as we
approached, and instantly followed us in and took
their seats on the back rows. After the lecture
was over they formed round us, as on the evening
before, escorted us home, gave us three deafening
cheers, and dispersed. The explanation of all
which was, that, hearing rumours of renewed
rioting, a certain number of manly men among the
students had resolved that the thing should not
be, and for the next two or three days this same
stalwart body-guard awaited and attended us
daily, till the rowdies tacitly agreed to lay aside
hostilities. Then I myself asked our volunteer
guard to discontinue their most chivalrous escort,
and quiet was restored.</p>

<p>No further event of importance occurred during
the winter, except the meetings of Infirmary
contributors, at the first of which a close contest
took place between managers known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
be favourable to us and those known to be
unfriendly. A new Act came into operation
at this date, and all the managers had to vacate
their seats unless re-elected. I can give no
more significant proof of the immense amount
of pressure brought to bear by the medical clique
than by stating that, of the three medical men
who had voted for us six weeks before, it was
found when the day of election came that two had
turned their coats, while the one who refused to
do so was unseated by the medical body that he
had represented!</p>

<p>At the Contributors’ Meeting on <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 2, 1871, at
which six managers were to be elected, the Lord
Provost himself proposed the election of six gentlemen
known to be friendly to the admission of
ladies to the Infirmary; but by the very narrow
majority of 94 votes to 88, the managers previously
on the Board were returned. No other
question was raised, and those who voted with
the Lord Provost did so simply in consequence of
the importance they attached to the exclusion of
the ladies by those managers who now desired
re-election.<a name="Anchor_92" id="Anchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a></p>

<p>At a subsequent meeting, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
Charteris brought forward a motion expressive of
the desire of the contributors that immediate
arrangements should be made for the admission
of the ladies, and this motion was seconded by
Sir James Coxe, M. D., but was lost by a similarly
small majority. On this latter occasion, two
incidents occurred that deserve notice. Firstly,
a petition in favour of the ladies’ admission was
presented, signed by 956 women of Edinburgh.<a name="Anchor_93" id="Anchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a>
Secondly, Mrs Nichol, an elderly lady whose
name is venerated throughout Edinburgh, made,
in spite of ill health, the great exertion of coming
forward at that public meeting, to ask one question,&mdash;“not,”
as she distinctly said, “in the
interests of the lady students, but on behalf of
those women who looked forward to see what
kind of men were they who were to be the sole
medical attendants of the next generation of
women, if women doctors are not allowed.” The
question which she said she had been commissioned
to ask by more than 1300 women, belonging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>to all classes and all parts of the country, was
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“If the students studying at present in the Infirmary cannot
contemplate with equanimity the presence of ladies as
fellow-students, how is it possible that they can possess either
the scientific spirit or the personal purity of mind which
alone would justify their presence in the female wards during
the most delicate operations on, and examinations of, female
patients?”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This question was received, according to the
newspaper report, with “<em>Laughter, hisses, and
applause</em>,” but no one opened his mouth to reply.
Perhaps in truth no reply could have been more
significant than the burst of yells and howls
which greeted the question from a gallery filled
by students, who indeed so conducted themselves
generally as to elicit a remark to me from
a learned Professor, famous for his quaint sayings:
“Well! ye can say now ye’ve fought with beasts
at Ephesus!”</p>

<p>About the same time a petition, signed by
twenty-three male students,<a name="Anchor_94" id="Anchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a> was presented to
the Infirmary managers, praying that the lady
students should no longer be excluded, but no
attention was paid to the request; and when
subsequently a similar application was made to
the Managers by a deputation of very influential
citizens,<a name="Anchor_95" id="Anchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a> they again refused, by a majority, to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
anything in our behalf. Professor Balfour moved
the appointment of a Committee to enquire into
a scheme for the instruction of ladies proposed by
certain of the medical officers of the Infirmary,
but Professor Christison carried an amendment
negativing even this measure; and thus another
year of Hospital instruction was lost.</p>

<p>With each succeeding Session new students
joined our small class, partly in consequence of
the very kind encouragement held out by Lady
Amberley, Dr Garrett Anderson, and other
friends, in the way of Scholarships; for, since
public indignation was excited by the refusal of
the Hope Scholarship to Miss Pechey, hardly a
term has passed without some generous offer of
valuable prizes for those ladies who needed such
assistance to pursue their studies, and who, by
their success in competitive examinations, showed
themselves worthy of them. Such kindness is
the more valuable at a time when, by incessant
delays and constantly-recurring difficulties, every
effort is evidently being made to exhaust alike
the patience and the purses of the troublesome
women who desire to complete the work they
have begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span></p>

<p>It is not necessary for me to enter into details
respecting the ladies’ progress in their studies,
further than to state that in every course in which
they have competed for prizes, more than half of
the whole class have been in the honours list, and
in some cases every lady student has so appeared;<a name="Anchor_96" id="Anchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a>
so that any refusal to grant them further instruction
can hardly be based on the plea that they
have not done their best to avail themselves of
what was already afforded.</p>

<p>During the two years, 1869&ndash;70 and 1870&ndash;71,
the five original students who entered in 1869 had
completed the first half of their University course,
partly by attendance on separate classes in the
University, and partly by means of extra-mural
lectures. But at the end of these two years a
dead-lock appeared imminent. The rules of the
University forbid any student to take more than
four classes outside the walls, and those four
classes we had already taken. Professor Christison
and others, whose classes came next in term,
gave a curt refusal to our request for instruction,
although we again offered to guarantee any fee
that might be required. In this dilemma we
applied for help to the Senatus, and suggested
that, if no other means could be devised, the
difficulty might be solved in either of two ways&mdash;(1)
by appointment of special University lecturers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
whose payment we would guarantee; or (2) by
the relaxation in our case of the ordinary regulations,
so that we might take an increased number
of extra-mural classes. When these proposals
came before the Senatus, it was decided to take
a legal opinion as to the rights and powers
of the University; and an opinion adverse to
our interests having been given, the Senatus
decided, on July 28, 1871, by a majority of
one, that they would take no action in the
matter.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, a Committee<a name="Anchor_97" id="Anchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a> of friends
which had been formed for our assistance, caused
a statement of the facts to be drawn up and submitted
to other Counsel, and obtained from the
Lord Advocate and Sheriff Fraser an Opinion to
the following effect:<a name="Anchor_98" id="Anchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a>&mdash;That it was quite competent
to the University authorities to make any
necessary provision for the completion of the
ladies’ education; and that the Medical Faculty
were bound to admit the ladies to professional
examination on the subjects in which they were
already qualified to pass.</p>

<p>I must explain that the advice of counsel had
been asked on this last point in consequence of a
rumour that difficulties might be made respecting
the examination that was now due at the end of
two years of professional study. The first official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
notice on this subject was, however, received by
us on Saturday, October 14, after the fees for
such examination had been paid, and tickets of
admission obtained; the examination itself being
due on the 24th of the same month, and the
ladies concerned having studied for two years
with the view of passing this examination, for
which they had more especially been preparing
assiduously for the last six months.</p>

<p>On the following Monday, October 16, I, moreover,
received an official notice that the Dean of
the Medical Faculty had been interdicted by the
Faculty from giving to ladies any papers for the
Preliminary Examination in Arts, which was to
take place <em>on the following day</em>, October 17!
Three ladies had come up to Edinburgh from
different parts of the country with the express
object of passing these examinations, and, if prevented
from doing so, they would be retarded in
their studies to the extent of one year. The
excessive shortness of the notice given made it
impossible even to appeal to the Senatus, and the
only course open to me was to submit the facts
for the opinion of counsel. This was done, and
we were informed that the course taken by the
Medical Faculty was quite illegal,<a name="Anchor_99" id="Anchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a> while an express
invitation to lady students formed part of the
official calendar of the University. This opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
was forwarded to the Dean, whose kindness to us
had been invariable; and, I am sure that he was
glad by it to be released from the painful necessity
of obeying the Medical Faculty in this matter.
The ladies were accordingly examined in the
ordinary course.</p>

<p>But the excitements of the month were not yet
at an end. On applying for matriculation tickets
the ladies were informed by the Clerk that the
Principal, Sir Alexander Grant, had written him
word that, in consequence of representations made
to him by Professor Christison, he desired that no
ladies should at present be allowed to matriculate.
On this point, and that regarding the Professional
Examination, we, of course, appealed at once to
the Senatus. At the meeting at which our
appeal was considered, “the Committee for securing
complete Medical Education for Women in
Edinburgh” also presented the opinion obtained
by them from counsel, together with a letter
urging that complete provision should be made
for our instruction. At their meeting on October
21, the Senatus at once decided both points of
appeal in our favour. The Principal’s prohibition,
which had never had any legal weight, was overruled,
and the permission to women to matriculate
and pass the Arts Examinations was renewed, and
declared to be in force so long as the present
regulations stood in the calendar. The Medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
Faculty also were instructed at once to admit the
ladies who were prepared for it to the Professional
Examination on the following day; and I
am happy to say that, in spite of the incessant
worry to which they had been subjected for the
past ten days, they all passed successfully. I am
sure that all those who have had to prepare for
severe University examinations will appreciate the
difficulties under which they did so.<a name="Anchor_100" id="Anchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a></p>

<p>A few days later came a meeting of the University
Council, when Dr Alexander Wood made
a gallant attempt to get a vote passed to the
effect that “the University is bound, in honour
and justice, to render it possible for those women
who have already commenced their studies, to
complete them.”<a name="Anchor_101" id="Anchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a> The <cite>Lancet</cite> remarked, respecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>this motion:&mdash;“This is precisely the ground
we have always taken up about the matter; and
we hope that the General Council of the University
will, by the adoption of Dr Alexander Wood’s
motion, put an end to the controversy which had
redounded so little to the credit of that school.”<a name="Anchor_102" id="Anchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a>
A memorial in favour of the resolution was also
presented, signed by more than nine thousand
women, residing in all parts of the country, and
representing almost every rank in society.<a name="Anchor_103" id="Anchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a> Very
vigorous opposition to it was, however, made by
Professors Turner, Thomson, and Christison, all
of whom were members of the Medical Faculty,
and ultimately an amendment, which proposed to
leave the question to be settled by the Senatus
and University Court, was carried by 107 votes
to 97.<a name="Anchor_104" id="Anchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a></p>

<p>At a meeting of the Senatus held on <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 30th,
the question of making further provision for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
the instruction of women was brought forward,
and a letter was received from the Committee
of our friends stating that, “in the event of
special lecturers being appointed by the University
to give qualifying instruction to women,
the Committee are willing to guarantee the
payment to them of any sum that may be fixed
by the Senatus for their remuneration, in case
the fees of the ladies are insufficient for that
purpose; and that, if necessary, they are willing
further to undertake to provide such rooms
and accommodation as may be required for the
delivery of the said lectures, if it should be
found absolutely impossible for the University to
provide space for that purpose.” After a long
debate the Senatus decided, by a majority, that
they would not take any steps to enable us to
complete our education. At a meeting a few days
later the Senatus further decided, by fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
votes to thirteen, to recommend to the University
Court that the existing regulations in favour of
female students be rescinded, without prejudice,
however, to the rights of those already studying.
This resolution was, as I said, passed by fourteen
votes to thirteen, and it may be worth while to
mention that two of the fourteen votes were those
of Dr Christison and Sir Alexander Grant, who
were themselves members of the University Court
to which the recommendation was to be made.
That the proposed measure was not the wish of
a real majority of the Professors was soon made
abundantly clear, for a protest against it was sent
up to the Court, signed by eighteen out of the
thirty-five Professors of the University, while two
out of the remaining seventeen were persistently
neutral, never indeed having voted on the question
from first to last. In the teeth of this protest
it was, of course, almost impossible that the
Regulations could be rescinded, and so they were
once more confirmed by the University Court on
January 3, 1872.</p>

<p>The next event of importance was the annual
re-election of Infirmary managers, six of
whom were to be chosen at the contributors’
meeting at the beginning of January 1872. As
on a former occasion, the election evidently turned
wholly on our admission to, or exclusion from, the
Infirmary wards. The medical party moved the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
re-election of the former managers, and they were
sure of the support of everybody who did not consider
our admission a vital question. Our friends,
on the contrary, brought forward a list of gentlemen,
all of whom were known to be friendly to
our cause. After a very warm debate the list of
our friends proved to be successful, being supported
by 177 votes, while 168 were recorded on
the other side. Professor Masson then moved
that a Statute be enacted by the Court of Contributors,
giving the same educational advantages in
the Infirmary to female as well as to male students.
The hostile party, finding themselves in a minority,
endeavoured to prevent this being put to the
vote on technical grounds which were subsequently
found to be of no legal importance.
Failing in this, they then adopted the remarkably
dignified course of decamping in a body, accompanied,
I must confess, by some ironical cheers
from those left behind. In the lull that succeeded
Professor Masson brought forward his motion,
which was seconded by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr Guthrie, and
passed without a dissentient voice. This Statute
is, therefore, now actually law in the Infirmary,
and considering that managers friendly to us had
also been elected, it might have been thought
that our difficulties there were at end. But now
comes the most extraordinary part of the whole
story. On a scrutiny of the votes it was found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
that with the majority had voted twenty-eight
firms, thirty-one ladies, and seven doctors. On
the other side were fourteen firms, two ladies,
thirty-seven doctors, and three druggists. These
figures may seem, indeed, to have a tolerable moral
significance, but it is not with that that I am at
this moment concerned. It occurred to the defeated
party that here might be found a straw
for them, drowning, to catch at,&mdash;that possibly a
legal objection might be sustained against the
votes of firms which were so largely in our favour,
and that, if so, the victory might yet be secured!<a name="Anchor_105" id="Anchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a>
The result was, that, when the Contributors
assembled at the adjourned meeting,<a name="Anchor_106" id="Anchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106.">[106]</a> for the
purpose of hearing the result of the scrutiny and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
the final declaration of the election, the Lord
Provost found himself served with an Interdict
forbidding him to declare the new managers
duly elected, on the ground that the votes of
firms were incompetent, and that by means of
these the majority had been obtained!</p>

<p>Instances have occurred before now where
personal feelings have triumphed over public
interests, but I do not think that I ever heard
of quite so reckless a course as this, by which
the medical clique has plunged the great Edinburgh
Hospital into litigation, and that with
some of its own most generous supporters, rather
than allow a dozen women to obtain in its wards
the instruction that the Contributors had decreed
they should receive!<a name="Anchor_107" id="Anchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107.">[107]</a></p>

<p>The litigation thus begun is still pending, and
the incomplete Board of Managers have for all
these months carried on the business of the Infirmary
without any representatives at all from
the Court of Contributors; and it is probable
that they make the very fact of their deficient
numbers the excuse for having up to this moment
given no effect whatever to the Statute unanimously
passed in our favour last January by the
Court of Contributors. We applied immediately
after the meeting for tickets of admission, but
were told that the managers must first be consulted,
and from that day to this no tickets have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
been issued to us, though the statute referred to
legally secured that “henceforth all registered
students of medicine shall be admitted to the
educational advantages of the Infirmary, without
distinction of sex.” The matter, however,
can now be only one of time; and, since the law
of the Infirmary is at length on our side, our
opponents may, I think, rest assured that our
patience in awaiting the end will be at least equal
to theirs. In all such struggles a present triumph
may be snatched by those in brief authority, but
the future belongs inalienably to the cause of
justice and liberality.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I had, on behalf of my
fellow-students and myself, appealed to the University
Court to provide us with the means of
completing our education, and our friends of the
Committee also forwarded to the Court a further
legal Opinion from the Lord Advocate and Sheriff
Fraser, to the effect,&mdash;that the University authorities
had full powers to permit the matriculation
of women in 1869; that the Resolutions then
passed amounted to a permission to women to
“<em>study medicine</em>” in the University, and that
therefore the women concerned were entitled to
demand the means of doing so; and finally,
that if such means were persistently refused,
the legal mode of redress lay in an Action of
Declarator.<a name="Anchor_108" id="Anchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 108.">[108]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span></p>
<p>On January 8th, 1872, the University Court
declared that they could not make any arrangements
to enable us to pursue our studies with a
view to a degree, but that, <em>if we would altogether
give up the question of graduation</em>,<a name="Anchor_109" id="Anchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109.">[109]</a> and be content
with Certificates of Proficiency, they would
try to meet our views!</p>

<p>In reply, I represented to the Court that no
“Certificates” were recognised by the Medical
Act, and that any such documents would therefore
be perfectly useless to us. I further urged
that as matriculation fees had been exacted from
us, in addition to the fees for tuition, and as we
had been required to pass the Preliminary Examination
“<em>for the medical degree</em>,” and as some of
our own number had moreover passed the first
Professional Examination, I could not but believe
that we were entitled to demand the means of
completing the ordinary University education,
with a view to obtaining the ordinary degree;
such belief being moreover confirmed by the
emphatic opinion of very distinguished counsel.
On these grounds I entreated the Court to reconsider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>their decision, and made the following
suggestion:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“That, as the main difficulty before your honourable Court
seems to be that regarding graduation, with which we are not
immediately concerned at this moment, we are quite willing
to rest our claims to ultimate graduation on the facts as they
stand up to the present date; and, in case your honourable
Court will now make arrangements whereby we can continue
our education, we will undertake not to draw any arguments
in favour of our right to graduation from such future arrangements,
so that they may at least be made without prejudice to
the present legal position of the University.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I appeal to every intelligent man and woman
to say whether these words, taken in connection
with my previous argument, were in the slightest
degree ambiguous, or whether any doubt could
really exist that in them I was pleading for
facilities for such an education as would ultimately
enable us to become legal practitioners of medicine,
although I was willing that the actual question
of graduation should remain in abeyance for
a few months, till decided by legal authority, or
otherwise. The public evidently so understood
my letter, which was published in the papers, for
it was considered that I had substantially gained
my end, when the following reply from the secretary
of the Court was also published:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I am desired to inform you that you appear to ask no
more than was offered by the Court in their resolution of the
8th ultimo, in which it was stated that, while the Court were
restrained by legal doubts as to the power of the University
to grant degrees to women from considering ‘the expediency
of taking steps to obtain, in favour of female students, an
alteration of an ordinance which might be held not to apply
to women,’ they were ‘at the same time desirous to remove,
so far as possible, any present obstacle in the way of a complete
medical education being given to women; provided
always that medical instruction to women be imparted in
strictly separate classes.’ On the assumption, therefore, that
while you at present decline the offer made by the Court with
reference to certificates of proficiency, you now ask merely
that arrangements should be made for completing the medical
education of yourself and the other ladies on behalf of whom
you write, I am to state that the Court are quite ready to meet
your views. If, therefore, the names of extra-academical teachers
of the required medical subjects be submitted by yourself,
or by the Senatus, the Court will be prepared to consider the
respective fitness of the persons so named to be authorised to
hold medical classes for women who have, in this or former
sessions, been matriculated students of the University, and
also the conditions and regulations under which such classes
should be held. It is, however, to be distinctly understood
that such arrangements are not to be founded on as implying
any right in women to obtain medical degrees, or as conferring
any such right upon the students referred to.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>My friends, as I say, congratulated me on this
apparently important concession; but to make
assurance doubly sure, I resolved to have absolute
official confirmation of the apparent meaning
of the Resolution, and therefore addressed another
letter to the Court, in which, after thanking them
for their apparent good intentions, I enquired
whether I was correct in understanding&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“1. That, though you at present give us no pledge respecting
our ultimate graduation, it is your intention to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
the proposed extra-mural courses as ‘qualifying’ for graduation,
and that you will take such measures as may be necessary
to secure that they will be so accepted, if it is subsequently
determined that the University has the power of granting
degrees to women.</p>

<p>“2. That we shall be admitted in due course to the ordinary
Professional Examinations, on presentation of the proper
certificates of attendance on the said extra-mural classes.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In reply, I was calmly informed that the Court
meant nothing of the kind; that they would not
agree to count any classes we might take as
qualifying, and that in fact they would not stir a
finger in any way whatever to enable us to
become legally qualified doctors, though they
might, if we spent a good many years of labour
and a quite unlimited sum of money in obtaining
our education, give us at the end these wonderful
Certificates of Proficiency, which would be
worth exactly&mdash;Nothing!</p>

<p>What had been the meaning of the previous
letter of apparent concession I confess myself
quite at a loss to conceive. What advantage
could accrue to us from submitting the names of
extramural teachers to the Court, in which Professor
Christison was the only medical man, I
have never been able to guess, since the Court
did not intend to take any means to make their
teaching qualify for graduation, and we hardly
needed its sanction in order to make private arrangements
for non-qualifying instruction! One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
is inclined to wonder whether the idea was
that the University Court possessed some supernatural
power, analogous to that supposed by
certain churches to reside in episcopal laying on
of hands, which would in a miraculous way benefit
those lecturers whom they might “authorise”
to teach us, though such teaching was to be given
in place and manner wholly unconnected with
that University with which I had supposed their
functions to be exclusively connected. However,
I am content to leave this among the unexplained
mysteries, with very hearty thankfulness that, at
least, by timely enquiries, we saved ourselves
from a still more hopeless waste of time and
money, which indeed we were on the point of
incurring, in reliance on the good faith of the
Court, and the apparent meaning of its mysterious
Resolution.<a name="Anchor_110" id="Anchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 110.">[110]</a></p>

<p>Having, however, at length arrived at a certainty
that the Medical Faculty would rest with
nothing short of our expulsion, if by any possibility
they could attain that end; that the Senatus,
though far more friendly, had not a sufficient
majority of liberal votes to secure the permanent
concession of our claims, however just, in the teeth
of the strong medical opposition; and that the
University Court would offer only such concessions
as were quite valueless for our end, it became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
clear that it was useless to prolong the series of
supplications which had, for nearly a year, been
addressed in vain to one after another of the
the ruling powers of the University.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we had no less authority
than that of the Lord Advocate of Scotland for
believing that we were absolutely entitled to
what we had so humbly solicited, and that a Court
of law would quietly award to us what seemed
unattainable by any other means; we had the
very widely spread and daily increasing sympathy
of the community at large, and received constant
offers of help from friends of every kind, who were
none the less inclined to befriend us because our
opponents stood in high places, and were utterly
relentless in their aims and reckless in their
means. Under these circumstances, we have
done the one thing that remained for us to do,
we have brought an action of Declarator against
the Senatus of the University;&mdash;praying to have it
declared that the Senatus is bound, in some way
or other, to enable us to complete our education,
and to proceed to the medical degree which will
entitle us to take place on the Medical Register
among the legally qualified practitioners of medicine.
By this action it will be decided,&mdash;once
more to quote our great champion, the <cite>Scotsman</cite>,&mdash;whether,
indeed, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>“a University can, with formal
solemnity, and with the concurrence of all its
component parts, decree the admission of women
to study for the profession of medicine, and then
deny them access to those means by which alone
they can enter that profession; whether, indeed,
a University is absolved from all duties towards
such of its matriculated students as may have
the misfortune to be women. It will have to be
decided whether any corporate body can make
a contract of which all the obligations are on one
side, and can exact fees and demand obedience to
regulations, without in its turn incurring any
responsibility; and can at pleasure finally send
empty away those whose presence is inconvenient,
without any regard to the money and time and
labour which they have expended in simple reliance
upon its good faith.”<a name="Anchor_111" id="Anchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 111.">[111]</a></p>

<p>It is a very great satisfaction to me to find that
some of the most illustrious members of the
Senatus have expressed their own opinion on
these points in the most emphatic way, for they
have refused utterly to be parties to the defence
of this action, and have entered on the Record a
Minute from which I extract the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We dissent from and protest against the
Resolution of the Senatus of March 27, 1872, to
undertake the defence of the action. This we do
for the following reasons:&mdash;(1.) Because we see no
just cause for opposing the admission of women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>to the study and practice of medicine, but on the
contrary, consider that women who have honourably
marked out such a course of life for themselves,
ought to be forwarded and aided in their
laudable endeavour as much as possible, by all
who have the means, and especially by those
having authority in any University or other
Institution for Education; (2.) Because in particular,
we feel such aid and encouragement,
rather than opposition and discouragement, to be
due from us to those women who have enrolled
themselves in the University of Edinburgh, and
we entirely concur with respect to them, in the
desire expressed by Sir William Stirling-Maxwell,
the Rector of the University, that they should
obtain what they ask&mdash;namely, a complete medical
education, crowned by a degree; (3.) Because we
have seen no sufficient reason to doubt the legal
and constitutional powers of our University, to
make arrangements that would be perfectly adequate
for the purpose, and we consider the public
questioning of such powers, in present circumstances,
by the University itself, or any of its
component bodies, unnecessary, impolitic, and
capable of being construed as a surrender of permanent
rights and privileges of the University,
in order to evade a temporary difficulty; (4.) Because,
without pronouncing an opinion on the
question now raised as to the legal rights which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>the pursuers have acquired by matriculation in
the University, admission already to certain examinations,
or otherwise, to demand from the
University continued medical instruction and the
degree on due qualification, we yet believe that
they have thereby, and by the general tenor of
the proceedings, both of the Senatus and of the
University Court in their case, hitherto acquired
a moral right, and created a public expectation,
which the University is bound to meet by the
full exercise of its powers in their behalf, even
should it be with some trouble; (5.) Because,
with these convictions, and notwithstanding our
utmost respect for those of our colleagues from
whom we may have the misfortune to differ on
the subject, we should individually feel ashamed
of appearing as defenders in such an action, and
should account any such public appearance by us
in the character of opponents to women desiring
to enter an honoured and useful profession, a
matter to our discredit.”<a name="Anchor_112" id="Anchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 112.">[112]</a></p>

<p>And so I have brought down as clearly and as
briefly as I have been able the history of this
great struggle to the present moment, for that
it is a great struggle, and one that will astound
most of those who may read these lines some
thirty years hence I think no thoughtful person
will deny.</p>

<p>I should like in conclusion to say a very few
words on two only of the general questions which
are bound up with the final solution of the problem
of the Medical Education of Women.</p>

<p>And, first, as to the difficulties which are, or
are not, inherent in the admission of women to a
University, and especially in them studying in
mixed classes. I believe most firmly that if,
when we first applied for admission in Edinburgh,
we had simply been given the ordinary tickets,
and, if either no notice had been taken of our
entering the classes, or the other students had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
been invited, as they were by Dr Alleyne Nicholson,
to join in welcoming us to their midst, no
difficulties would ever have arisen at all; or at
least no difficulties but might have been most
easily smoothed away by any manly teacher with
a real reverence for his subject, and a belief in the
profound purity of Science.<a name="Anchor_114" id="Anchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 114.">[114]</a> I am sure that in
theory it is both possible and right for ladies and
gentlemen to study in the same classes any and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
every subject which they need to learn, and I
have very little doubt that this will ultimately
be the usual arrangement as civilization advances.
But I am equally certain that boys of a low social
class, of small mental calibre, and no moral training,
are utterly unfit to be admitted to a mixed
class, and I confess that I was most painfully surprised
in Edinburgh to find how large a number
there are of medical students who come under
this description. I had honestly supposed, as I
wrote three years ago, that ladies need fear no
discomfort in an ordinary medical class, as “the
majority of the students would always be gentlemen.”<a name="Anchor_115" id="Anchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 115.">[115]</a>
I regret that on this point I have been
compelled somewhat to modify my opinion, though
I would fain hope that the circumstances which
obliged me to do so were to a great extent exceptional
and local.<a name="Anchor_116" id="Anchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 116.">[116]</a> Nor do I think it possible that
a mixed class can be satisfactorily conducted by
any man who is not capable of inspiring his
students with a reverence for purity, or who does
not naturally teach them alike by example and
precept, that the fear of competition is essentially
low and mean, and that the acme of degradation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
is reached when strength of any kind is used for
the injury or annoyance of the weaker or less protected;
and, this being so, I acquiesce very
heartily in the decision that, at present, wherever
professors and students think it necessary, women
shall be taught medicine only in separate classes,
though I hope, even in my life-time, to see the
day when such regulations are no longer required,
because students and teachers alike have risen to
a higher moral level.<a name="Anchor_117" id="Anchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 117.">[117]</a> In the meantime, let us
but be granted permission to acquire our knowledge
in separate classes, at whatever cost, and
the authorities may be very sure that we shall
not trouble them with requests again to be subjected
to the unsavoury companionship of which
we had such full experience in 1870&ndash;71.<a name="Anchor_118" id="Anchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 118.">[118]</a></p>

<p>And, lastly, with regard to future legislation
respecting medical practice, I would say but one
word. It is clearly right that, for the protection
of the helpless and ignorant, the State should
take means to distinguish between competent and
incompetent practitioners of medicine, and I hope
that women as well as men will always be required
very thoroughly to prove their fitness for practice
before they are allowed to undertake it, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
least under national sanction. But it is not in
the least for the good of the nation that any
monopoly should be encouraged, whether in matters
of teaching, examination, or practice. Is it
not simply shameful that all that I have now been
relating should be <em>possible</em> in this country, and
possible because of a law which appoints but one
door to the medical profession,&mdash;that of Registration,&mdash;limits
Registration to those who have
passed through certain definite Schools, and satisfied
certain definite Boards, and yet allows those
Schools and Boards absolute power to shut their
doors on one-half of the human race, and that
even in the case of Universities largely subsidised
from public funds, and at a time when the public
are positively clamouring for women doctors for
women? We can see plainly enough why it is
(in the lowest sense) the interest of medical men
to exclude women from their profession,&mdash;though,
thank God, there are hundreds of medical men
who would scorn to put their interests in one
scale when justice weighed down the other,&mdash;but
it is <em>not</em> the interest of the public or of the nation
to sanction any such monopoly;<a name="Anchor_119" id="Anchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 119.">[119]</a>&mdash;it is their interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>to throw open the gates of competition as
widely as possible, insisting only on a uniform
standard of attainment for all, of either sex, who
would enter them; for, by thus increasing the
supply of really competent doctors, they give
themselves the best possible opportunities of
selection; and, as I have pointed out elsewhere,
they double the chances of growth and advance
in the fields of medical science.</p>

<p>When this momentous question again comes
before Parliament, I trust that the issues involved
will be fully realised; and that, while providing
for the most stringent examination of every candidate,
no arbitrary barrier will be placed in the
way of any, and no regulations be allowed to
stand which militate against the good old English
motto for all,&mdash;a Fair Field and no Favour!</p>

   On this point I may quote the following passage from the
<cite>Scotsman</cite>, whose great influence has always been most nobly
exerted in this question on the side of justice and liberality, and
to whose help in arousing the moral sense of the community, we
owe a debt that we can never hope to pay. The words quoted
occur in a leading article referring to a meeting of the General
Council, of which mention will be found elsewhere:&mdash;“Even Dr
Christison, who is well known to be in truth the very soul and
centre of the opposition, and whose personal influence alone has
probably prevailed to carry it on so long in the teeth of public
opinion, thought it advisable to say at the Council meeting, that
‘if anything could be done to get the ladies out of their difficulty,
he should be glad to be one to give them assistance.’ This expression
sounds somewhat farcical to those who are aware that
the present dead-lock arises simply from the fact that the ladies’
studies have now brought them to that point at which Dr Christison’s
class comes next in turn to be attended, and that the Professor,
in spite of his verbal gallantry, has flatly refused either to
instruct them himself or facilitate arrangements by which any one
can do so in his place.”&mdash;<cite>Scotsman</cite>, October 31, 1871.

   As some attempts have been lately made to throw doubt on
the validity of the regulations just quoted, and, in fact, on the
legality of the matriculation of women, I think it well to specify
distinctly certain of the persons who were most immediately concerned
in the University action just described. The University
Court which drew up the above regulations, contained among its
members Mr Moncreiff, then Lord Advocate of Scotland, and Mr
Gordon, who had held the same office under a previous Government,
besides two other legal members. The Chancellor who
gave his express sanction to all the measures taken, was Lord Glencorse,
(Inglis,) the Lord Justice-General of Scotland. I leave the
public to judge how far it is probable that these gentlemen conjoined
to do an illegal and invalid act on behalf of the University.

   I fully agree in the following remarks made by a local paper
when the results of the next summer term were declared:&mdash;“The
whole number of gentlemen who appear in the prize-lists (in
Botany) are 32, out of 140 competitors,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, about 23 per cent.;
of the ladies, <em>all</em>. We believe that these results prove, not that
women’s capacities are better than those of men&mdash;a thing that
few people would assert&mdash;but that these women who are devoting
themselves to obtain, in spite of all difficulties, a thorough
knowledge of their profession, are far more thoroughly in
earnest than most of the men are, and that their ultimate success
is certain in proportion. Nor would we omit the inference that,
this being so, those who wantonly throw obstacles in the way of
this gallant little band incur a proportionately heavy responsibility,
as wanting not only in the spirit of chivalry, but even in the
love of fair play, which we should be sorry to think wanting in
any Briton.”&mdash;<cite>Daily Review</cite>, August 5, 1870.

   The following passage occurs in a leading article on the riot
got up in Philadelphia by male medical students, when in 1869
ladies were first admitted to the Pennsylvania Hospital:&mdash;“Their
riotous procedure is just a manifestation of the same
trades-union spirit that will stoop to any meanness, join in any
tyranny, be guilty of any cruelty, rather than allow interference
with what is considered as its ‘vested rights.’ In last week’s
<cite>Lancet</cite> we find a letter from a medical man, who asks with <i>naïve</i>
surprise whether the advocates of female physicians can possibly
be aware that there are hundreds of medical <em>men</em> not able to make
a comfortable living! We know not which most to admire&mdash;the
cool assumption that the medical profession exists only or mainly
to fill the pockets of its members, or the serene assurance that
takes it for granted that no woman has a right to expect to be
allowed the chance of earning a living, till all male competitors
are safely and sufficiently provided for! It is rather amusing
to contrast the evidently keen dread of successful competition
which degrades a man thus to plead <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in formâ pauperis</i>, with the
voluble assurances, in this and other medical papers, that nature
has clearly interdicted to women the practice of medicine, and
that here at least they cannot but utterly fail.”&mdash;<cite>Scotsman</cite>, <abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 4,

   “In answer to an incorrect statement which appeared in one
of the medical papers respecting his class, Dr Alleyne Nicholson has
forwarded to its editor a letter, from which we extract the following
passage:&mdash; ... “The course of lectures on Zoology, which I am
now delivering to a mixed class, is identically the same as the course
which I delivered last winter to my ordinary class of male students.
I have not hitherto emasculated my lectures in any way whatsoever,
nor have I the smallest intention of so doing. In so acting, I am
guided by the firm conviction that little stress is to be laid on the
purity and modesty of those who find themselves able to extract
food for improper feelings from such a purely scientific subject as
zoology, however freely handled. ‘To the pure all things are
pure.’” In the moral courage and manly purity of the above
letter we find fresh cause to congratulate the ladies on the teacher
they have secured on a subject which might easily have been made
offensive by a man of prurient mind. As teachers of truly scientific
spirit become more common, we shall, doubtless, hear less and
less of the difficulties of giving instruction to classes composed of
medical students of both sexes.”&mdash;<cite>Daily Review</cite>, June 14, 1870.

   I am sorry to say that hardly a year later a majority of these
lecturers were so overborne by the prevailing medical influence,
that they rescinded the above regulations, merely permissive as
they were, and, in spite of the remonstrances of the gentlemen
whose classes we had attended, passed a resolution forbidding any
of their number to instruct lady students, either in mixed or
separate classes, in Surgeons’ Hall. That no doubt whatever
might remain as to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">animus</i> which dictated this resolution,
they distinctly confined the prohibition to the case of ladies <em>who
were registered students of medicine</em>,&mdash;expressly allowing the continued
instruction of midwives! I wish that space would permit

of ten. As we then pointed out, the issue before the General
Council was neither more nor less than this&mdash;to keep faith with
the female students whom the University had allowed to proceed
two years in their medical curriculum. The Council was not
asked to commit itself in the slightest degree to any opinion,
favourable or unfavourable, to the admission of ladies to a medical
career. It had only to concede, in common courtesy, not to say
common fairness, the right to which the best legal advice had
clearly shown the female students to be entitled,&mdash;the right to
carry on the studies they had been allowed to prosecute half way
towards graduation. Will it be believed? An amendment postponing
the settlement of the difficulty till it had been duly considered
by the authorities of the University was put and carried;
as if there was any more room for “consideration” in the

towards seven ladies whom she first accepted as pupils, and

of firms had, as has now been ascertained, sat over and
over again on the Board of Management, and on the Committee
of Contributors. It was of equally slight importance that the
firms whom it was now sought to disqualify had been among the
most generous benefactors of the charity, and that, with the imminent
prospect before them of great pecuniary necessity, it would
probably be impossible, without their aid, to carry out even the
plans for the new building. The firms had voted in favour of the
ladies, and the firms must go, if, at least, the law would (as it
probably will not) bear out the medical men in their reckless
endeavour to expel them.”&mdash;<cite>Scotsman</cite>, January 29, 1872.

   At this meeting a Committee of Contributors, previously appointed,
reported in favour of the admission of lady students, and
against the exclusion of the votes of firms, and this Report was
approved by 232 votes to 227. On this occasion there voted for
the approval of the Report 41 ladies and 10 doctors; against it,
6 ladies, 44 doctors, and 5 druggists.

   In support of this suggestion the Court remarked that the
question had been needlessly “complicated by the introduction
of the subject of graduation, which is not essential to the completion
of a medical or other education.” They <em>forgot</em>, however,
to mention that though a degree is “not essential” to a medical
education, it <em>is</em> absolutely indispensable to any practical use of
it,&mdash;that is to say, to any lawful practice of the medical profession.

action, I believe that it is understood that such decision did not
imply, on the part of all who acquiesced in it, any moral conviction
that we are not entitled to obtain the desired Declarator,
since several other Professors appear to have agreed in feeling
with the six dissentients, but to have acquiesced in the defence

<p>The following are a few only out of many indications of the existence of
the painful feeling alluded to in the text. The reader will hardly need
to be reminded that this is especially a subject respecting which a maximum
of feeling may well exist with a minimum of expression, for hardly
anything but a sense of duty would make a woman write on such a question
to the newspapers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="spread-out_dots">..</span>. “But there remains to be considered the modesty and delicacy of the
patients,&mdash;a question hardly yet mooted; these poor women having, I suppose, too
much of the reality to raise the point. It cannot be denied that at least one-half of
the patients of medical men are women, or that usually (from natural causes) they
require medical services more certainly and frequently than men; and operations
delicate or indelicate, so called, must be performed, questions, delicate or indelicate,
must be asked, and answered too, if not by the patient herself, by the nurse, who, I
believe, is usually a woman.</p>

<p>“There is much reason to believe that many women, either owing to the nature
of their malady, or from constitutional nervousness or reserve, never avail themselves
of the services of a medical man without reluctance. To them it is always a
painful effort&mdash;the twentieth time as much as the first. It would, I think, be odd if
something of this kind were not felt very strongly by every woman on some occasions,
and I have seen very experienced mothers quite distressed, if by any chance, they
were deprived of the assistance of ‘the doctor they were used to.’ The wives of
medical men have told me that it was their one comfort to feel that in their hour of
suffering only their own husband and a good nurse need be with them. I think this
is not unnatural.”&mdash;Letter by “<span class="smcap">Medicus</span>,”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, May 11, 1870.</p>

<p class="new_quote">“I happened to be speaking to a young shopwoman&mdash;a total stranger to me&mdash;and
in the course of conversation advised her to seek medical advice, when she replied,
with a sudden gush of tears in her eyes, that she <em>had</em> been in the Infirmary, in Dr
Matthews Duncan’s wards for a fortnight, and had during that time suffered so much
from the constant presence of crowds of male students during certain inevitable but
most unpleasant examinations of her person, that, as she herself forcibly expressed
it, ‘it almost drove me mad.’”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>Daily Review</cite>, Nov. 18, 1870.</p>

<p class="new_quote">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;A new obstacle has been thrown in the way of women acquiring a knowledge
of the medical profession. The special obstacle at present is injury to the
delicacy of mind of the male students. This delicacy, if real, must be a serious drawback
to the proper exercise of their profession in after life. That it is so, many a
suffering woman knows.</p>

<p>“The question, however, arises&mdash;which evil is the greater,&mdash;that five hundred
youths, in full health and vigour, should be made a little uncomfortable by the
presence of seven women, or that seven times five hundred women, unnerved by
suffering, should be subjected to the very trial they shrink from.</p>

<p>“That women do truly shrink from this trial, the number of wretched, broken-down
sufferers from chronic disease but too clearly proves. It is only when racked
by constant pain that a woman’s natural delicacy at last gives way, often only to hear
said the words (how bitter they are!) ‘too late.’</p>

<p>“The returns of the Registrar-General could easily prove the vast sacrifice of life,
did delicacy not again step in with ‘consumption and liver complaints,’ as more
euphonious terms for the real disorders of which these are the mere after-results.</p>

<p>“This objection, looked at fairly, is a case of the delicacy of five hundred men <i>versus</i>
that of all suffering women.</p>

<p>“I think most thoughtful women will bear testimony to the amount of preventible
suffering that passes unaided, because the natural sensibilities of women prevent their
resorting with comfort to treatment by medical men for certain diseases. I can
count almost by dozens the cases which have come under my personal observation
of health ruined, and life’s pleasures and usefulness alike lost with it, because young
girls (and sometimes older women too) will not submit to receive from a man, however
respected, the personal examination and treatment necessary for their restoration,
and because no woman’s skill has been at their command. Let your readers divest
themselves for a moment of conventional habits of thought, and inquire what would
then be their instinctive opinion of the existing custom which compels one sex to be
dependent on the other for medical treatment of the most delicate kind. Imagine
the case reversed. If henceforth women alone were to attend on men, what would
the world say to that? At any rate, is it not time that women should at least be
allowed a choice in this matter? And if this be so, it is clear that some women must
be thoroughly educated for the medical profession....&mdash;I am, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <span class="smcap">A Woman</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In the present controversy regarding the extension to women of facilities
for obtaining a complete medical education, it is reiterated on one side that there is a
no demand among women themselves for doctors of their own sex. In visiting a
district of nine families in a poor quarter of the Old Town, inhabited principally by
Irish, I found four women seriously out of health; not so seriously, however, but
that they might have been cured by timely medical advice. I urged each of them
more than once to go to the Dispensary, but all persistently refused, each of them
saying in different words that, if ladies were doctors, as they had heard they were in
some places, they would have had medical advice long before. The feelings of these
poor women were so strong on the subject that I found it was useless to urge them
further. It seems only just and reasonable that qualified female medical attendants
should be within the reach of those who either have a strong preference for it, or
who will not avail themselves of any other.&mdash;I am, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <span class="smcap">A District Visitor</span>.”</p>

the effect of the medical treatment. It is surely time for men to cease to
speak of what <em>women feel</em> in this matter. It is impossible for them to know what

their stammered request for advice. What women need is, that some of their

<p>In answer to the sufficiently arrogant enquiry from Dr Henry Bennet,&mdash;“What
right have women to claim mental equality with men?”&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
addressed the following letter to the <cite>Lancet</cite>, and as it seems to me to sum
up our position fairly enough, I here reprint it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="notes_place_date"><span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, June 21st, 1870.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I see in your columns of June 18th a letter on ‘Women as Practitioners of
Midwifery,’ and appeal to your sense of fairness to allow me a fourth part of the
space it occupied, for a few words in reply.</p>

<p>“It is hardly worth while to discuss the early part of the letter, as the second
paragraph sufficiently disposes of the first. After saying that women are ‘sexually,
constitutionally, and mentally unfitted for hard and incessant toil,’ Dr Bennet goes
on to propose to make over to them, as their sole share of the medical profession,
what he himself well describes as its ‘most arduous, most wearing, and most unremunerative
duties.’ In the last adjective seems really to lie the whole suitability of
the division of labour, according to the writer’s view. He evidently thinks that
women’s capabilities are nicely graduated to fit ‘<em>half-guinea</em> or <em>guinea</em> midwifery
cases,’ and that all patients paying a larger sum, of necessity need the superior
powers of the ‘<em>male</em> mind of the Caucasian race.’ Let whatever is well paid be left
to the man, then chivalrously abandon the ‘badly remunerated’ work to the woman.
This is the genuine view of a true trades-unionist. It is well for once to hear it
candidly stated. As I trust the majority of medical men would be ashamed of
avowing such a principle, and as I am sure it would be indignantly disavowed by the
general public, I do not care to say more on this point.</p>

<p>“But when Dr Bennet proceeds to dogmatise about what he calls our claim to
‘mental equality,’ he comes to a different and much more important question. I,
for one, do not care in the least either to claim or disown such equality, nor do I see
that it is at all essential to the real question at issue. Allow me to state in a few
words the position that I, and, as I believe, most of my fellow students take. We
say to the authorities of the medical profession, ‘State clearly what attainments you
consider necessary for a medical practitioner; fix your standard where you please,
but define it plainly; put no obstacles in our way; either afford us access to the
ordinary means of medical education, or do not exact that we shall use your special
methods; in either case subject us ultimately to exactly the ordinary examinations
and tests, and, if we fail to acquit ourselves as well as your average students, reject
us; if, on the contrary, in spite of all difficulties, we reach your standard, and fulfil
all your requirements, the question of ‘mental equality’ is practically settled, so far
as it concerns our case; give us then the ordinary medical license or diploma, and
leave the question of our ultimate success or failure in practice to be decided by ourselves
and the public.’ This is our position, and I appeal, not to the chivalry, but to
the justice, of the medical profession, to show us that it is untenable, or else to concede
it at once.&mdash;I am, Sir, your obedient servant, <span class="smcap">Sophia Jex-Blake</span>.”</p>

<p>The statement in the text was made the subject of a newspaper controversy;
and I append the following very valuable evidence which was
thus elicited in support of my assertion:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Permit me to bear my testimony to the state of the facts on this question
as far as English convents are concerned. I was for some years medical attendant to
a Franciscan convent, and was frequently consulted by the nuns. They were examined
and treated like other patients, except where certain maladies were concerned,
and then they suffered in silence, or with such relief as could be given by medicines,
after a diagnosis founded on questions and general symptoms only. I especially
remember two cases.... In neither of these any examination was permitted,
or any surgical treatment regarded as a possibility, in spite of all the representations
I could make, and although, I believe, I possessed the full confidence of the patients
and of the Superior. Whether a female surgeon would have been allowed to examine
and operate I cannot say.&mdash;I am, Sir, yours, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, F.R.C.S.”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>Lancet</cite>, May 18, 1872.</p>
<p class="new_quote">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Kindly permit me to say a few words with regard to Miss Jex-Blake’s
statement, that very many women, and in particular, nuns, would certainly show a
preference for the medical and surgical aid of one of their own sex, were any choice
possible to them. As being myself a Catholic, and having many near relatives nuns,
I can most confidently confirm this assertion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
“I have known, for many years, and in the closest intimacy, ladies, members of
various religious orders, in this country and in France, and I am quite aware that
recourse to male medical advice, in peculiar cases, is looked upon in religious houses
as something much more painful than any physical suffering, or even death.</p>

<p>“My father was medical attendant to a convent of English nuns, and I think I
may safely say that any advice given to nuns in such cases was entirely at second
hand, the doctor’s wife being the favourite resource in these emergencies....</p>

<p>“Then, again, how can any man, medical or not, know what agonies of shame
and outraged modesty women can and do undergo, when submitting to male medical
and surgical treatment? How many women cannot overcome their repugnance, and
die with their special ailments unsuspected, or discovered too late? On the other
hand, how many women are at great pains to <em>conceal</em> the shrinking which they feel
when exposing their peculiar ailments to even a long-known and valued medical man?
Why should we have these added to our other unavoidable sufferings? The reality
of these feelings is, I am certain, within the personal knowledge of every one of your
female readers. No one wishes to deny modesty to the stronger sex; but let us
suppose them <em>compelled</em> to reveal all their physical ills to <em>women</em>&mdash;how would they
feel?&mdash;I am, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <span class="smcap">A Catholic Wife and Mother</span>.”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>Scotsman</cite>, May 27, 1872.</p>

<p>While reviewing the above for the press (May 1872), the following
lines came under my notice, and I think them the more suitable to quote
as they are from the pen of a woman who has never herself shown the
least inclination for the study of medicine, and who, therefore, speaks
entirely from the abstract point of view:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Nothing will ever make me believe that God meant men to be the ordinary
physicians of women and babies. A few masculine experts might be tolerated in
special institutions, so that cases of peculiar danger and difficulty might not be left,
as they are now, to the necessarily one-sided treatment of a single sex; but, in general,
if ever a created being was conspicuously and intolerably out of his natural
sphere, it is in my opinion, the male doctor in the apartment of the lying-in
woman; and I think our sex is really guilty, in the first place, that it ever allowed
man to appear there; and, in the second, that it does not insist upon educating
women of character and intelligence and social position for that post.</p>

<p>“Indeed, common delicacy would seem to demand that all the special diseases of
women should be treated principally by women; but this aside, and speaking from
common sense only, men may be as scientific as they please,&mdash;it is plain that thoroughly
to know the women’s organism, what is good for it and what evil, and how it can best be
cured when it is disordered, one must be one’s self a woman. It only proves how
much unworthy passion and prejudice the great doctors allow to intrude into their
adoration of ‘pure science’ and boasted love of humanity, that, instead of being
eager to enlist the feminine intuitions and investigations in this great cause, as their
best chance of arriving at truth, they are actually enacting the ignoble part of churls
and misers, if not of quacks. For are they not well enough aware that often their
women patients are so utterly beyond them that they do not know what to do with
them! The diseases of the age are nervous diseases, and women are growing more
nervously high-strung and uncontrollable every day, yet the doctors stand helplessly
by and cannot stop it. When, however, there shall be a school of doctresses of high
culture and thorough medical education going in and out among the sex with the
proper medical authority, they will see, and will be able to prevent, much of the
moral and physical neglect and imprudence which, now unchecked in school and
home, make such havoc of the vital forces of the present generation.”</p>

<p>“For ourselves, we hold that the admission of women into the ranks of medicine
is an egregious blunder, derogatory to the status and character of the female sex,
and likely to be injurious, in the highest degree, to the interests and public estimation
of the profession which they seek to invade.</p>

<p>“By insisting on the attendance of all students at the public-class delivery of
anatomical lectures, and in the public-class dissecting-room, the only possible guarantee
of uniformity of teaching will be obtained, and, at the same time, a difficulty will
be placed in the way of female intrusion which it will not be easy for women of character,
and clearly none else are eligible, to surmount. We hope, however, that the Court of
Examiners will not stop with the erection of the barrier we suggest, but that they will
distinctly refuse to admit any female candidate to examination unless compelled by
a legal decision from the bench; and we also hope that they will be supported in
such refusal by the Master and Wardens of the Society, as well as by the profession
out of doors.”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>Medical Times and Gazette</cite>, <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 27, 1867.</p>

<p>Since the first admission of women to the University of Zurich in 1867,
five women have taken degrees there in Medicine, but none at present in
any other Faculty. During the present year (1872) there are at Zurich
no less than 51 women studying in the Medical Faculty, and 12 in that
of Arts.</p>

<p>“Now at last the vexed question of mixed classes will be solved, and there can be no
doubt in the minds of those who have ever been engaged in scientific study of the
favourable result to be expected. It is curious to note in the history of the present
movement how, one after another, old objections have vanished, and old arguments
have become no longer available. It is pretty certain that this last, and perhaps
greatest, stumbling-block to the minds of many will also disappear when it is seen
with what beneficial results the system of mixed education is attended. And one
great advantage to be expected is the benefit that will accrue from the higher reverence
for science that must necessarily result from such a system. Once admit the
impropriety of teaching men and women together, and you tax science with impurity;
and while such a feeling is entertained (and it surely must be lurking in the minds of
those who oppose mixed classes), the study of science, if not absolutely injurious,
must be robbed of great part of its power to elevate the mind and heart....
Science has had to fight many a hard battle. For a long time it was asserted that
science and religion were antagonistic to each other, but a Faraday has shown us how
the two may go hand in hand, each helping and supporting the other. Last April we
were told that the study of science was linked with impurity of thought, and we look
upon the present action of the Lecturers of Surgeons’ Hall as a result of the indignant
protest which every pure-minded man of science must have longed to utter
against such a wholly false and calumnious statement. It is as the champions of
science rather than of medical women that these gentlemen must be regarded. In
any case science would have passed through this last attack, as she has ever done
through all similar attacks, victorious and unscathed and unrestrained in her power
to bless and help mankind; but the lecturers of our city have the no small honour of
having publicly testified their unqualified conviction of the entire purity of all scientific
knowledge and research.... Now that the Lecturers of Surgeons’ Hall
have come forward as a body to affirm the same principle, we may indeed hail the
beginning of the end, and may trust soon to see the day when the man who condemns
the teaching of science to classes of both men and women will simply stand self-convicted
as wanting alike in true scientific spirit and in genuine purity of mind.”</p>

<p class="notes_ref"><cite>Daily Review</cite>, July 11, 1870.</p>

<p class="new_quote">“It seems that two ladies have this week applied for admission as students to St
Thomas’s Hospital in London, and a medical contemporary makes this fact the excuse
for a fresh onslaught on all women who may, for the sake of a thorough medical education,
wish to enter the existing schools which at present possess a legal monopoly
of that education. The editorial delicacy declares&mdash;‘that any women should be found
who desire such fellowship in study is to us inexplicable.’ This ill-bred sneer directed
against ladies as medical students is peculiarly ill-timed at a moment when the
medical profession are loudly calling on women to come to their aid in the military
hospitals of the Continent, teeming, as we know them to be, with horrors which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
certainly far surpass any that ladies are likely to encounter in their ordinary course of
study, and which must inevitably be witnessed in company ‘with persons of the
opposite sex.’ Certainly no reasons of delicacy at least can justify women’s co-operation
in the one case, and yet demand their exclusion in the other.</p>

<p>“The truth is, that of course a certain conventional standard of propriety exists,
which it is well and desirable to maintain under ordinary circumstances, as between
persons of opposite sexes; and this rule forbids the casual discussion of most medical
and some scientific subjects in chance audiences composed of ladies and gentlemen.
But a higher law remains behind&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salus populi suprema Lex</i>. If perishing humanity
cries aloud for help, as during the present fearful struggle, we should think little of
the pretended delicacy which could hinder either men or women from flocking to the
rescue, and bid them pause, ‘in the name of modesty,’ to consider whether, under
these circumstances, drawing-room proprieties would always be observed. So, too,
when the question really at stake is whether all women are to be deprived of the
medical services of their own sex, for fear some men’s ‘delicacy’ should be shocked
by the idea of their studying in the ordinary class-rooms, it is time to protest that,
true science being of necessity impersonal, is absolutely pure. We remember that,
when an attack was made on Dr Alleyne Nicholson a month or two ago, for admitting
women to his classes, he replied in a letter to one of the medical papers, that he laid
‘small stress on the purity or modesty of those who find themselves able to extract
food for improper feelings from a purely scientific subject,’ and we confess that we
are inclined to share his opinion, which we suspect will be that of all the noblest and
most enlightened men of science.</p>

<p>“A great deal of nonsense has been talked with reference to ‘mixed classes,’ and
as it is probable that the subject may come up again in a practical shape before long,
it is as well to say a few plain words about the question at issue. First of all, let it
be clearly established that medicine cannot be taught advantageously, nor indeed
legally, in holes and corners to half-a-dozen or even a dozen students. In the very
paper in which appeared the offensive paragraph to which we have alluded, we find
a plea for the consolidation of the London Medical Schools into a smaller number,
because ‘there are not students enough’ to support them all in perfection, and because
two or three well-paid lecturers with abundant apparatus could teach to far greater
advantage than twice or thrice that number under present circumstances. If this is
true where there are at least several hundred students to be divided among the eleven
existing schools, how palpably absurd it is to recommend our countrywomen to ‘have
separate places of medical education and examination,’ when the whole number of
ladies desiring to study medicine in England may perhaps number a score! Our own
University professors tell us plainly that separate classes for half-a-dozen ladies are an
impossibility, and the practical experience of Surgeons’ Hall, pointing in the same
direction, evidently guided its lecturers in their recent vote. The broad fact, therefore,
must be accepted, that either the door must be shut in the face of all women,
and that at a moment when some of them are proving to a demonstration their remarkable
fitness to enter it, or they must be allowed, as they long ago requested, to enter
quietly and without remark, and take their places with other students, to learn the
common lessons equally necessary for all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span></p>

<p>“And, after all, what are the arguments on the other side? We are told oracularly
that what is proposed is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contra bonos mores</i>, and are warned with equal
solemnity of the imminent downfall of any school that dares to break loose from the
bondage of Medical Trades-Unionism and afford to women exactly the same advantages
as to other students. We do not wish to speak solely, or even chiefly, in the
interests of women; we wish to look at the question broadly and with a view to the
possible moral results to the public at large; and from this point of view we cannot
but feel that the more general association of the sexes in earnest labour, and especially
in scientific and medical study, may be of the greatest importance to the community.
Though the traditions of the Bob Sawyer period are happily passing away,
there yet seems to linger an idea that medical students as a rule adopt a lower moral
standard and are of a more generally reckless character than those studying for other
professions. If this is so, may not the explanation be found in the sort of half-expressed
idea that seems prevalent in so many people’s minds that there is in medical
study something which, if not actually improper and indelicate, certainly tends that
way, and had better be ignored as much as possible&mdash;something at least which the
average public would probably sum up as ‘rather nasty.’ We believe that it is on
this popular idea&mdash;which every true physician would indignantly disclaim&mdash;that the
opponents of women’s education trade when they try to enlist public feeling against
mixed classes. They talk in a vague and very offensive way about certain studies
which form a necessary part of medical education, and not being themselves capable
of seeing the true dignity and profound purity of all science, especially when pursued
with the aim of succouring pain and combating disease, they manage too often
to impress the general public with the idea that by sanctioning the joint study of
medicine by men and women the said public would commit itself to some shocking
impropriety, all the more awful for being quite indefinite&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omne ignotum pro magnifico</i>.
It is probable that this sort of vague terror is, in fact, the best weapon yet
forged against women students, but, like many another terror, it is one that vanishes
in the clear daylight. Let it once be broadly understood that science has no hidden
horrors, that the study of God’s works can never be otherwise than healthful and
beautiful to every student who brings to their contemplation a clear eye and a clean
hand, and this weapon of darkness will be shivered for ever. We believe, indeed,
that nothing could be more desirable for the average young medical student than to
find himself associated in daily study with women whom he cannot but respect;
nothing more calculated to give him an earnest sense alike of the dignity and of the
purity of his vocation than to labour in it side by side with ladies whose character
and whose motives are to him a daily reminder that he and they alike are set apart
both as the votaries of science and the ministers of suffering humanity.”</p>

<p>The following extracts will show the position and opportunities of
study enjoyed by lady probationers and nurses at London hospitals. The
first is taken from a letter written by a lady who was herself trained as a
surgical nurse in a hospital. She writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the ordinary course of the day’s work, I went round the wards with the visiting
surgeons, and at the same time as the students, and, in fact, I should think, enjoyed
exactly the same opportunities that people profess to be so much shocked at your desiring
to obtain in Edinburgh. Part of my time was spent in study in the female and
part in the male wards; and I never found either students or patients see anything
at all exceptional in my presence in the latter, though I often had to perform
services for the male patients which would never be expected of you as students. When
any patients from my wards went into the theatre, for operation, I, as a matter of
course, accompanied them, and was present during the operation, standing often quite
near the surgeon, however many students might be there at the time. I was, therefore,
constantly associated with the students in the hospital work, as were all the other
ladies studying in the same capacity, and I never saw any difficulty in this arrangement,
nor had any reason to suppose that the students did.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Thinking that a lady’s evidence might be challenged on this matter,
I wrote to one of the principal surgeons of the Middlesex Hospital for
confirmation of her statement, and received the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Nurses and lady probationers are present in the wards, and attend the surgeons in
their visits, and are present at operations. The students never, so far as I observed,
took any notice of the question as to whether the female attendants in the wards were
ladies or ordinary nurses&mdash;never, in short, troubled themselves about them.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>While on the subject, I will quote an extract from a letter received
from Dr Elizabeth Blackwell, the first Englishwoman who ever received
a medical degree. She says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I walked St Bartholomew’s Hospital in the years 1850&ndash;51. I received permission
to do so from the Governors, and was received by the medical faculty with a friendly
courtesy for which I shall always be grateful. I always went round with the class of
students during the physician’s visits. The medical class numbered about thirty
students. I spent between five and six hours daily in recording and studying cases.
During the visits, I never received anything but courtesy from the students. When studying
in the wards, I received much kind assistance from the clinical clerks and dressers.
While leaving the hospital the treasurer said to me&mdash;‘When we gave you permission
to enter, we thought we were doing something so unusual that we were rather anxious
about the result, but, really, everything has gone on so quietly, so exactly as usual,
that we had almost forgotten you were here.’ ... My observation of mixed study
is, that a small select number of women may join an ordinary school with little difficulty,
and that there is even less trouble in arranging hospital visiting than class-room
instruction.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span></p>
<p>The last case that I will cite with reference to hospital instruction is
that of Mrs Leggett, who is now attending as a regular student in Steevens’
Hospital, Dublin, and who writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I had the unanimous consent of the Board to pursue my medical studies in
Steevens’ Hospital. As to the medical students, they are always civil. Dr Macnamara,
President of the College of Physicians of Ireland, said it was his opinion that the presence
of ladies would refine the classes.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>With reference to the attendance of this lady, Dr Hamilton, Medical
Secretary of Steevens’ Hospital, writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“So far as we have gone, we find the education of mixed classes in one hospital to
work very well.”</p>

<p>The following are a few only out of very many expressions of public
indignation at this episode:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“One of the most singular of University ‘scandals’ comes to us from decorous
Edinburgh. True, it is the very antithesis of cases&mdash;such as are only too familiar on
this side the Border&mdash;of debauchery at night, and a scene in court next morning, but
it is not a whit the less discreditable. The transgressor, however, is not a college
student, but a college professor. The case admits of, we might say demands, historic
treatment. Some years ago, Dr Hope, then Professor of Chemistry in the University,
gave a course of lectures to ladies&mdash;at that time quite an experiment&mdash;and was so
much gratified, we are told, at their popularity, that he devoted the proceeds, amounting
to about a thousand pounds, to found what have since been termed Hope Scholarships.
We now get to a very modern period indeed. The Chemistry class during last
winter numbered no less than 236 students, of whom six were ladies, who had been
admitted to study in the medical classes, ‘in accordance with the decision of the
University authorities at the beginning of the session.’ A few days ago the results of
the examination were made known, when it appeared that one lady, Miss Mary
Edith Pechey, was in the proud position of third in the list of honours, and
another lady, Miss Sophia Jex-Blake, tenth. Miss Pechey’s success is the more gratifying,
inasmuch as she is a fresh student, while the two gentlemen who stood above
her on the list have attended a previous course of lectures. Dr Crum Brown, the
Professor of Chemistry, in announcing the results, took upon himself to say that
he should pass over Miss Pechey and award one of the Hope Scholarships to the next
male on the list. This is directly in the teeth of the regulations made and provided
for his guidance; according to which these scholarships are to be awarded to ‘the
four students whose names stand highest in the chemistry class for the session.’ We
understand that Professor Crum Brown justifies his action on the ignoble plea ‘that
the women now studying in the University class do not form part of the University
class, on account of their meeting at a different hour.’ Great indignation has very
naturally been excited in Edinburgh by this incident, and the question has been
referred to the Senate of the University, who, though a corporate body, will, we hope,
act as honourable men.”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>Manchester Examiner and Times</cite>, April 6, 1870.</p>

<p class="new_quote">“The inferior sex has always been a nuisance and a bore. A wise old Sultan of
Turkey used to ask, whenever anything went wrong, ‘Who was she?’ One day while
the Sultan was making an addition to his palace (as is the habit of Sultans), a labourer
fell from the scaffold and was killed. ‘Who was she?’ said the Sultan at once. The
inferior sex is always plaguing the superior sex in one way or another, and now it
seems that the inferior sex are winning <em>our</em> scholarships over our most sacred heads.
This is a matter which must be looked to. We will stand a great deal, but this is
going a little too far; we must agitate; members must pledge themselves on the
hustings to a bill providing that any one of the inferior sex who gains a scholarship
must not have it at any price whatever, or we shall all be undone. We must have an
Act for the repression of women; we are very sorry to say such terrible words, but
the thing must be done: it had better be done at once while the nation is in a mood
for repression. Particular cases thrust themselves prominently on the national mind,
and cause legislation: the Coercion Bill for Ireland was thrust on to an unwilling
Government by a very few of the later agrarian outrages: the last ounce breaks the
camel’s back. If Miss Edith Pechey chooses to come in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facile princeps</i> at the head of
the Chemistry Class of her year, we of the superior sex must really look to ourselves.
We have the power of legislation still left in our hands, and we warn such ladies as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
Miss Edith Pechey and Miss Jex-Blake that we shall use it. We must have a bill for
the protection of the superior sex.</p>

<p>“We feel sure that the ladies will forgive joking about a very absurd matter.
Ladies should surely understand the power of ridicule. We think that the ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio
ad absurdum</i>’ in this matter is the proper line of argument. The facts of the case
seem to be simply these:&mdash;After protracted delays and much discussion, the University
authorities last autumn vouchsafed to ladies the permission to enter the College
as matriculated medical students, with the single restriction that their instruction
should be conducted in separate classes. On referring to the minutes of the University
Court, we find the following definition of the position to be taken by the new
students:&mdash;‘All women attending such classes shall be subject to all the regulations
now, or at any future time, in force in the University as to the matriculation of
students, their attendance on classes, examination, or otherwise.’ We turn to the
Calendar to see what are the ‘regulations in force in the University’ as to examination
in chemistry, and we find at page 84 the following:&mdash;‘The class honours are determined
by means of written examinations held during the session. The four
students who have received the highest marks <em>are entitled to have the Hope Scholarships</em>
to the laboratory of the University.’ The ladies accepted in good faith the regulations
of the University, and, fired by a laudable ambition to prove themselves
worthy of the privileges now accorded for the first time to women, worked with an
assiduity that may be guessed when it is found that one of them, Miss Pechey, actually
gained the highest number of marks awarded during the session to any student attending
chemistry for the first time, though she was excelled (by one and two marks
respectively) by two gentlemen who had gone through a previous course of lectures.
But when the day arrived which was to reward all this work, the Professor announced,
without, as it seemed to us, a shadow of justification, that the four scholarships would
be given, <em>not</em> according to the University regulations to the four students ‘<em>entitled
to them</em>,’ but to the three gentlemen who had won the first, second, and fourth places,
and to the one who stood fifth on the list, this last having earned a most honourable
place by his talents and industry, but <em>not</em> the Hope Scholarship, though now he has,
of course, the right to claim free admission to the laboratory as it has been promised
to him. This, then, is a University episode. Six students are admitted on the distinct
understanding that, with one exception (dictated, as we think, by a whimsical
propriety), they are to be ‘subject to the regulations of the University;’ no hint is
given to them that this statement is analogous to the one which pithily describes
women’s political condition in England&mdash;‘<em>He</em> means <em>she</em> when it’s a question of hanging;
<em>he</em> doesn’t mean <em>she</em> when it’s a question of voting.’ The ladies are encouraged
to exert their utmost power for work; when the rewards are to come, and it is found
that one of them has earned one of the highest honours attainable by the class, she
is calmly informed that that honour has been given to somebody else! A neater instance
of generosity with other people’s property it has never been our lot to witness,
and we don’t care how long it is before we repeat the experience.</p>

<p>“The only excuse that we can with the utmost stretch of charity imagine in this
case would be that Dr Crum Brown thought some difficulty might arise respecting
Miss Pechey’s use of the scholarship (which gives free admittance to the laboratory),
under the restrictions now imposed on women by the University Court&mdash;for we will
not suppose for a moment that the Professor could himself wish to impede the further
progress of a student of such merit. But if such difficulty occurred it might be an
excellent reason for relaxing those restrictions, when they are seen to deprive a
student of the full reward of her past work, and at the same time to prevent her prosecuting
further the study in which she has so distinguished herself; but we are
quite at a loss to see how any legitimate argument can be drawn thence to justify Dr
Brown in laying violent hands on a scholarship which has been fairly earned by one
person for the purpose of presenting it to another. It is possible that A’s circumstances
may prevent his deriving full benefit from some of his possessions, but the
law would hardly consider this fact a valid reason for B’s ‘annexing’ the said possession
for the benefit of C. If Dr Brown chooses to admit a fifth student to the
laboratory he can of course do so, but unless we are greatly mistaken he will probably
be informed by the Law Faculty (whom he might previously have consulted
with advantage) that neither he nor any other person can alter the fact that Miss
Pechey and no one else <em>is</em> third Hope Scholar.”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>Daily Review</cite>, April 1, 1870.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span></p>

<p class="new_quote">“A very odd and very gross injustice appears to have been attempted in the University
of Edinburgh. In that University the lady medical students are taught in a separate
class,&mdash;not from any wish of their own, but through the delicacy of the professors.
In the chemical class, Miss Edith Pechey gained the third place, and was first of the
first year’s students, the two men who surpassed her having attended the class before.
The four students who get the highest marks receive four Hope Scholarships,&mdash;scholarships
founded by Dr Hope some years ago out of the proceeds of a very popular
<em>ladies’ class</em> of chemistry, with the success of which he had been much gratified. Yet
Miss Edith Pechey was held by the professor not to be entitled to the third scholarship,
and omitting her name, he included two men whom she had beaten, and who
stood fourth and fifth in the examination, his excuse being that the women are not
part of the University class, because they are separately taught. Yet Dr Crum Brown
awards Miss Pechey a bronze medal, to which only members of the University class
are said to be entitled! It is quite clear that such a decision cannot stand. To make
women attend a separate class, for which they have to pay, we believe, much higher
fees than usual, and then argue that they are out of the pale of competition because
they do so, is, indeed, too like the captious schoolmaster who first sent a boy into the
corner and then whipped him for not being in his seat.”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>Spectator</cite>, April 9, 1870.</p>

<p class="new_quote">“The letter Miss Pechey addressed to us the other day was written in an admirable
spirit, and must insure her the hearty sympathy of all, whatever their opinions upon
the points in question. She has done her sex a service, not only by vindicating their
intellectual ability in an open competition with men, but still more by the temper
and courtesy with which she meets her disappointments. Under any view of the
main question, her case is a hard one, for it is clear both she and the other lady students
were led to attend the classes under the misapprehension of the privileges to
which they were admissable. If the University intended to exclude ladies from the
pecuniary advantages usually attached to successful study, the intention should have
been clearly announced. Miss Pechey, in the spirit of a true student, says she is
abundantly repaid for her exertions by the knowledge she has acquired; but it is none
the less hard that, having been encouraged to labour for a coveted reward, and
having fairly won it, she should be disqualified by a restriction of which no warning
had been given her.”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>Times</cite>, April 25, 1870.</p>

<p class="new_quote">“There are probably few persons who did not learn with regret the decision of the
Edinburgh Senatus in respect of the Hope Scholarships. It is not pleasant that such
a story of, at least, seeming injustice should circulate through foreign universities, to
the discredit of our own, for there cannot be much doubt as to the view that will be
taken of the case by those nations&mdash;now forming the majority in Europe&mdash;who have
admitted women to their medical colleges on terms of exact fairness and equality with
their other students.... A medical contemporary argues that this affair proves
how unwise it was to admit women to the University of Edinburgh&mdash;such admission
being, as is asserted, the natural source of ‘constant squabbles.’ But most unprejudiced
people, judging the case at first sight, would surely rather see here the evil of
a partial, restricted, and permissive legislation. If women have a claim to medical
education at all, they have exactly the same claim as men; if they are to be received
as students at all, they must certainly be treated with even-handed justice, and not as
social or rather academical <i>pariahs</i>, to whom the bare crumbs of instruction are vouchsafed
as a grace and bounty; while all the honours and rewards are to be reserved to
their male competitors. Looking at the thing for a moment, merely in the interests of
the young men, and as a question of expediency, we cannot imagine anything much
worse for their moral guidance than to find that women are indeed to compete with
them, but so shackled that they can never win; or rather that, if they do win, the
prizes will be snatched from their grasp and given to men whom they have beaten. We
have heard that, in both classes where the ladies have this year studied, a very unusual
access of zeal and energy has been noticed among the gentlemen in the other section of
the class&mdash;a happy effect of such competition, which has often been observed in the
mixed colleges of America, and which surely need not be neutralised here by the providence
of the Senatus.”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>Scotsman</cite>, April 15, 1870.</p>

<p class="new_quote">“The Senatus has, by a small majority, confirmed Professor Crum Brown’s decision
with regard to Miss Pechey and the Hope Scholarship, on the grounds previously presumed
by us. But these grounds, if so they may be called, are in our opinion insufficient
to deprive Miss Pechey of the Scholarship. Whatever may be our views regarding
the advisability of ladies studying medicine, the University of Edinburgh professed
to open its gates to them on equal terms with the other students; and unless some
better excuse be forthcoming in explanation of the decision of the Senatus, we cannot
help thinking that the University has done no less an injustice to itself than to one of
its most distinguished students.”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>British Medical Journal</cite>, April 16, 1870.</p>

<p>For the credit of the profession, I append also the following indignant
protest from the chief medical paper:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There are very varying opinions abroad in the medical profession and among the
public, as to the advisability of allowing women to practise medicine. There are
still more serious and widely-spread doubts as to the possibility of educating ladies in
the same lecture rooms and dissecting rooms with male students. But, until last
week, we were not aware that any one in the profession, or out of it, held that the
mere fact of ladies wishing to be educated in common with men, in order that they
might make sure of receiving the highest and most thorough scientific training, justified
those who held contrary opinions in loading them with abuse and vulgar insult.
It has been reserved for Dr Laycock, professor in the famous University of Edinburgh,
to set an example which, we trust, even the least courteous and gentlemanly of first-year’s
students will hesitate to follow.... We shall only remark that if the
coarsest of those few students who still keep alive the bad traditions of the Bob
Sawyer period had given utterance to the insinuations which were used by this distinguished
Professor, we should simply have shrugged our shoulders, and concluded
that the delinquent would be at once expelled with ignominy from his school. Unfortunately
there are no such punishments for highly-placed men like Dr Laycock,
but at the least we can express the deep indignation and disgust which we are certain
every gentleman in the profession must feel at the outrage of which he has been
guilty.”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>Lancet</cite>, April 30, 1870.</p>

<p>The following are the papers referred to in the text:&mdash;</p>

<h4 title="" class="note_heading">(1.)&mdash;<i>Letter from the Lady Students.</i></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;We, the undersigned registered students of medicine,
beg to lay before you the following facts, and to request your kind attention to them:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On applying in the usual course for students’ tickets of admission to attend the
practice of the Royal Infirmary, we were informed by the clerk that the Managers
were not prepared to issue tickets to <em>female</em> medical students. We earnestly request
you to reconsider this decision on the following grounds:&mdash;</p>

<p>“1. That the authorities of the University of Edinburgh and of the School of the
College of Physicians and Surgeons have admitted our right to study medicine with
a view to graduation.</p>

<p>“2. That an important and indispensable part of medical education consists in
attending the practice of a medical and surgical hospital, and that the regulations of
the Licensing Boards require, as part of the curriculum of study, two years’ attendance
at a ‘general hospital which accommodates not fewer than eighty patients, and
possesses a distinct staff of physicians and surgeons.’</p>

<p>“3. That the only hospital in Edinburgh possessing the required qualifications is the
Royal Infirmary, and that exclusion from that institution would therefore preclude
the possibility of our continuing our course of medical study in this city.</p>

<p>“4. That, in the present state of divided opinion on the subject, it is possible that
such a consummation may give satisfaction to some; but we cannot suppose that your
honourable Board would wish to put yourselves in the attitude of rendering null and
void the decisions of the authorities of the University of which we are matriculated
students, and of the School of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, where we are
now attending the classes of anatomy and surgery.</p>

<p>“5. That it has been the invariable custom of the Managers to grant tickets of
admission to students of the University and of Surgeons’ Hall, and that, as far as we
are aware, no statute of the Infirmary limits such admission to students of one sex
only.</p>

<p>“6. That the advertised terms on which the wards of the Infirmary are open to
all registered and matriculated students were such as to leave no doubt on our minds
that we should be admitted; if, therefore, our exclusion should be finally determined,
we shall suffer great pecuniary loss and damage by this departure of the Managers
from their advertised regulations.</p>

<p>“7. That if we are granted admission to the Infirmary by your honourable Board,
there are physicians and surgeons on the hospital staff who will gladly afford us the
necessary clinical instruction, and find no difficulty in doing so. In support of the
above assertion, we beg to enclose the accompanying papers, marked A. and B.</p>

<p>“8. That we are fellow-students of systematic and theoretical surgery with the
rest of Dr Watson’s class in Surgeons’ Hall, and are therefore unable to see what
legitimate objection can be raised to our also attending with them his hospital visit.</p>

<p>“9. That a large proportion of the patients in the Infirmary being women, and
women being present in all the wards as nurses, there can be nothing exceptional in
our presence there as students.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span></p>

<p>“10. That in our opinion no objection can be raised to our attending clinical
teaching, even in the male wards, which does not apply with at least equal force to
the present instruction of male students in the female wards.</p>

<p>“11. That we are unable to believe it to be in consonance with the wishes of the
majority of the subscribers and donors to the Infirmary (among whom are perhaps
as many women as men) that its educational advantages should be restricted to
students of one sex only, when students of the other sex also form part of the regular
medical classes.</p>

<p>“We beg respectfully to submit the above considerations to the notice of your
honourable Board, and trust that you will reconsider your recent decision, which
threatens to do us so great an injury, and that you will issue directions that we, who
are <i>bona fide</i> medical students, registered in the Government register by authority of
the General Council of Medical Education and Registration of the United Kingdom,
be henceforth admitted to your wards on the same terms as other students.&mdash;We are,
my Lord and Gentlemen, yours obediently,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>November 5, 1870.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;As lecturers in the Edinburgh Medical School, we
beg most respectfully to approach your honourable Board, on behalf of the eight
female students of this school whom, we understand, you object to admit to the practice
of the Royal Infirmary. On their behalf we beg to state:&mdash;</p>

<p>“1. That they are regularly registered students of medicine in this school.</p>

<p>“2. That they are at present attending, along with the other students, our courses
of anatomy, practical anatomy, demonstrations of anatomy, and systematic surgery, in
the school at Surgeons’ Hall.</p>

<p>“3. That as teachers of anatomy and surgery respectively, we find no difficulty in
conducting our courses to such mixed classes composed of male and female students,
sitting together on the same benches; and that the presence of those eight female
students has not led us to alter or modify our course of instruction in any way.</p>

<p>“4. That the presence of the female students, so far from diminishing the numbers
entering our classes, we find both the attendance and the actual numbers already enrolled
are larger than in previous sessions.</p>

<p>“5. That in our experience in these mixed classes the demeanour of the students
is more orderly and quiet, and their application to study more diligent and earnest,
than during former sessions, when male students alone were present.</p>

<p>“6. That, in our opinion, if practical bedside instruction in the examination and
treatment of cases is withheld from the female pupils by the refusal to them of access
as medical students to the practice of the Infirmary, we must regard the value of any
systematic surgical course thus rendered devoid of daily practical illustration, as infinitely
less than the same course attended by male pupils, who have the additional
advantage of the hospital instruction under the same teacher.</p>

<p>“7. That the surgical instruction, being deprived of its practical aspect by the exclusion
of the female pupils from the Infirmary, and therefore from the wards of their
systematic surgical teacher, the knowledge of these female students may very reasonably
be expected to suffer, not only in class-room examinations, but in their capacity
to practise their profession in after life.</p>

<p>“8. That our experience of mixed classes leads us to the conviction that the attendance
of the female students at the ordinary hospital visit, along with the male students,
cannot certainly be more objectionable to the male students and the male patients than
the presence of the ward nurses, or to the female patients than the presence of the
male students.</p>

<p>“9. That the class of society to which these eight female students belong, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
with the reserve of manner, and the serious and reverent spirit in which they devote
themselves to the study of medicine, make it impossible that any impropriety could
arise out of their attendance upon the wards as regards either patients or male pupils.</p>

<p>“In conclusion, we trust that your honourable Board may see fit, on considering
these statements, to resolve not to exclude these female students from the practice of,
at all events, those physicians and surgeons who do not object to their presence at the
ordinary visit along with the other students.</p>

<p>“Such an absolute exclusion of female pupils from the wards of the Royal Infirmary
as such a decision of your honourable Board would determine, we could not but regard
as an act of practical injustice to pupils who, having been admitted to the study of the
medical profession, must have their further progress in their studies barred if hospital
attendance is refused them.&mdash;We are, my Lord and Gentlemen, your obedient servants,</p>

<p class="new_quote">At a meeting of the lecturers of the Extra-mural School, held in
Surgeons’ Hall, on Wednesday, Nov. 9, the following resolution was proposed
and carried, a corresponding communication being laid before the
Managers at their meeting on Saturday, Nov. 12, 1870:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

requesting your honourable Board to issue to us the ordinary students’ tickets for the
Infirmary (as they alone will ‘qualify’ for graduation), we have, in the event of their
being granted, no intention whatever of attending in the wards of those physicians and
surgeons who object to our presence there, both as a matter of courtesy, and because
we shall be already provided with sufficient means of instruction in attending the wards
of those gentlemen who have expressed their perfect willingness to receive us.&mdash;I beg,
my Lord and Gentlemen, to subscribe myself your obedient servant, <span class="smcap">Sophia Jex-Blake</span>.”</p>

<p>The following letter is an excellent illustration of the indignation felt
by the more manly students at the events referred to:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="notes_place_date">“<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, November 19, 1870.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;As a certain class of medical students are doing their utmost to make the
name of medical student synonymous with all that is cowardly and degrading, it is
imperative upon all those who wish to be regarded as men, either individually or
collectively, to come forward and express, in the strongest possible terms, their
detestation of the proceedings which have characterised and dishonoured the opposition
to ladies pursuing the study of medicine in Edinburgh. In the name, then, of all
that is courteous and manly, I, as a student of medicine, most indignantly protest
against such scenes as were enacted at the College of Surgeons on the evenings of
Thursday and Friday last, and indeed on several occasions during the week.</p>

<p>“I would it were possible to point out to public execration the movers and
actors in such scenes; but it is difficult to decide where the responsibility begins.</p>

<p>“Are only the hot-headed youths to be blamed who hustle and hoot at ladies in
the public streets, and by physical force close the College gates before them? Or are
we to trace their outrageous conduct to the influence of the class room, where their
respected professor meanly takes advantage of his position as their teacher to elicit
their mirth and applause, to arouse their jealousy and opposition, by directing unmanly
inuendoes at the lady students? If such conduct be permissible on the part of
the professors, alas for the school whose teachers have not even but one halfpennyworth
of manliness to their intolerable deal of nastiness, or boasted philanthropy, as
the case may be, and whose students crowd the academic precincts to hustle, hoot at,
cover with mud, and even to strike at, ladies who have always shown themselves to
be gentle and noble women.</p>

<p>“The current report is, that these disgraceful outrages were originally and principally
carried out by students of the College of Surgeons. This is contrary to fact.
Certainly the majority of them conducted themselves in a most contemptible manner,
roused, not by a word or look from the ladies, but by the possibility of being outstripped
by them in the race for honours; and therefore did they elect to end the
rivalry by an appeal to brute force. The truth, however, is that the rioters were
called together by a missive, circulated by the students in the <em>Chemistry Class of the
University</em> on Friday morning, on the back of which was written, “To be opened by
those who signed the petition to the managers against the admission of female students.”
This missive called upon the petitioners to assemble at the College of Surgeons
before four o’clock, for the purposes which they so thoroughly carried out. The proceedings
of Friday will therefore enable the public now to judge of the value which
the majority of the managers of the Infirmary ought to have attached to the prayers
of <em>such</em> petitioners. Moreover, the professor who is to receive the complimentary
address which is being got up by the same memorialists for his exertions in their
cause, must feel highly flattered by the implied association.</p>

<p>“What now is to be done with this vexed question of female education? Will it
be settled by continuing those brutal exhibitions, or by asking the ladies to withdraw?
Neither course is likely to prove successful. Another and a more honourable
course has been suggested by some of the original memorialists, who&mdash;considering
their honour dearer to them than their sympathies&mdash;declare that the blot can only be
wiped away by their joining to aid the ladies who have been so thwarted and so
abused in obtaining the object for which they have wrought so hard and endured so
bravely.&mdash;I am, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <span class="smcap">Vir.</span>”</p><p class="notes_ref"><cite>Scotsman</cite>, November 22, 1870.</p>

<p class="center">“<i>To the honourable the Managers of the Royal Infirmary.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;We, the undersigned Students of Medicine, moved
solely by feelings of honour and justice, desire to approach your honourable board
on behalf of our female fellow-students, whom, we understand, you object to admit
to the practice of the Infirmary, under any circumstances whatever.</p>

<p>“We do not pretend to offer any opinion on the question of mixed classes, or on
the medical education of women; but we consider that, as the University of Edinburgh
has admitted those ladies as students of medicine, and as they have now been
engaged for some time in striving honourably and successfully to gain a knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
of our profession, it is great injustice to attempt to bar their further progress by
refusing them permission to attend the practice of the Infirmary.</p>

<p>“We also have certain pretensions to feelings of decency and morality, but we are
not aware that the lady students have either attempted or succeeded in outraging
them. On the contrary, our feelings have been outraged by the unthinking and
misguided of those of our own class who oppose them; for their disgraceful actions
we would seek to atone by asking your honourable Board to make some arrangement
by which the ladies may be admitted to the practice of the wards.</p>

<p>“As a matter of compromise, we would respectfully request that the ladies be
admitted to the wards of the three medical gentlemen who are willing to receive
them. On our part we beg leave to express our perfect willingness to attend with
them in considering the most serious and delicate cases in the wards.</p>

<p>“We feel proud to assert our ability to study those cases from scientific and
philanthropic points of view, with those feelings of delicacy and kindness which
ought to actuate every medical man who has female patients under his care.”</p>

<p>The results of the winter session 1869&ndash;70 have been given in the text.
During the succeeding summer session all the lady students (six in number)
appeared in the prize lists in both classes which they attended, viz.,
Botany and Natural History. During the next winter, 1870&ndash;71, the
classes taken were Anatomy and Surgery. Out of seven ladies, three
were in honours in Anatomy (one of them in two departments), and four
in Surgery. During the summer of 1871 there were five lady medical students
in the Botany Class, and of these three appeared in the prize lists,&mdash;one of
them in two departments. During the winter 1871&ndash;72, nine ladies
attended Chemistry, and, of these, seven appeared in first-class honours,
Miss Pechey, in this her second course, obtaining 100 per cent.; nine also
attended Physiology, and, of these, two obtained first-class and three
second-class honours; six being also in honours in Practical Physiology.</p>

<p>It must be understood that, in the above statement, I have included
only those ladies who were regular students of medicine; other ladies, on
several occasions, joined the classes, and also appeared in the prize lists.</p>

<p class="center">“COMMITTEE FOR SECURING A COMPLETE MEDICAL EDUCATION
TO WOMEN IN EDINBURGH.</p>

<p>“In view of the determined opposition from certain quarters which has met every
effort made by ladies to obtain a medical education in Edinburgh, it was resolved, in
January 1871, that a Committee should be formed, comprising all those who felt the
injustice of the present arbitrary exclusion of women from the medical profession, and
who desired to co-operate in the following objects:&mdash;(1.) To arrive at a thorough
understanding of the real difficulties of the case, distinguishing clearly between those
hindrances which are interposed by prejudice or self-interest, and the real obstacles (if
any) which are inherent in the question. (2.) To secure the admission of women to
Edinburgh University on the ordinary terms, though not necessarily in the same
classes with men. (3.) To provide the means of qualifying Hospital instruction in
Edinburgh for all ladies who are registered students of medicine.</p>

<p>“To these primary objects the circumstances of the case have subsequently led the
Committee to add the following:&mdash;(4.) To make such temporary arrangements as may
be required to provide the ladies with qualifying instruction, in accordance with the
present incomplete regulations of the University, until such time as the authorities
themselves may see fit to make complete and adequate arrangements. (5.) To co-operate,
from time to time, with the lady students, whenever necessary, and especially
to aid them in obtaining such legal assistance as may be required to ascertain and
assert their rights as matriculated students of the University, and as registered students
of medicine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span></p>

<p>The case, drawn up by order of the Committee and submitted to
Counsel, contained the facts relating to the Edinburgh lady students,
which are narrated in the text, and further proceeded, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“ ... It is stated in ‘Maitland’s History of Edinburgh’ that the first mention
of erecting a College in Edinburgh was found in the will of Robert Reid, Bishop
of Orkney, who, dying in 1558, bequeathed eight thousand Scottish merks towards
founding a College ‘for the education of youth.’</p>

<p>“In the subsequent benefactions and charters granted by Queen Mary in 1566,
and by King James in 1582, no stipulation is made as to the sex of the students for
whose benefit the College was to be established; and in 1583 proclamation was made
inviting ‘all who were inclined to become scholars therein’ to enter their names in
a certain book opened for the purpose.</p>

<p>“The older University of Glasgow was founded under a Bull granted by Pope
Nicholas <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> at the suit of James <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> of Scotland, and in this Bull it was expressly
stated that the University of Bologna was to be followed as a model, and that the
doctors, masters, and students of Glasgow were to enjoy all the privileges and rights
possessed by those of Bologna. There is abundant historic evidence that women
were never excluded from the University of Bologna, but frequently studied and
took degrees there during the Middle Ages, and that no less than seven women at
different times filled professorial chairs in this University, three of them being in the
Medical Faculty, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dorotea Bucca, Professor of Medicine, early in the fifteenth century; Anna
Morandi Mazzolini, Professor of Anatomy, 1750; Maria Della Donne, Professor of
Midwifery, 1810.</p>

<p>“It appears that the University of Edinburgh was founded generally on the same
model, and the University Calendar states that ‘in 1621 an Act was passed by the
Scotch Parliament which ratified to the University, in ample form, all the rights,
immunities, and privileges enjoyed by other Universities in the kingdom.’</p>

<p>“There does not appear, in any of the statutes or ordinances subsequently issued,
any regulation that male students alone should attend the University; nor in the
recent Act of 1858 is there any such regulation. As a matter of fact, no applications
for admission to the University of Edinburgh seem to have been made by women
until the year 1869, as above mentioned.</p>

<p>“In the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1858, section 12, power was given to the
University Court ‘to effect improvements in the internal arrangements of the University,
after due communication with the Senatus Academicus, and with the sanction
of the Chancellor, provided that all such proposed improvements shall be submitted
to the University Council for their consideration.’</p>

<p>“By the same act (section 21), provision was made for ‘providing additional
teaching by means of assistants to the Professors in any professorships already established
or to be established,’ and several assistants were accordingly appointed by
the Commissioners under the Act; and, subsequently, the Senatus appointed certain
other assistants, and made them allowances out of the University revenues. None
of these assistants have, however, hitherto delivered courses of lectures qualifying
for graduation, though there does not appear to be any clause in the Act which forbids
their doing so. The only course of instruction qualifying for medical graduation
which is given entirely by an assistant is that of practical chemistry.</p>

<p>“During the illness or absence of professors, temporary substitutes to lecture in
their stead have frequently been appointed by the Senatus, with the sanction of the
University Court.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The following Queries were not all asked in the first instance, but in
part on a subsequent occasion (see <a href="#Page_120" title="Page 120"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 120</a>); as, however, they were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
submitted on the same case, and concern the same subject, I give them
here consecutively, arranged in the order in which the Opinions obtained
thereon were presented to the Senatus or University Court:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>Query</i> 1.&mdash;In the permission given to women to study ‘for the profession of
medicine’ in the University of Edinburgh (bearing date November 12, 1869), was it involved
in clauses 1, 2, and 6, that they should be allowed to pass the ordinary professional
examinations and to proceed to the degree of M.D. in the University, subject
only to the restrictions laid down in the said regulations; and is it therefore
incumbent on the Medical Faculty to admit them to the necessary examinations
to the extent of the subjects in which they are already qualified to pass?</p>

<p>“<i>Opinion.</i>&mdash;Reading the regulations referred to in connection with the resolutions
of the Medical Faculty which were approved of by the Senatus, the University
Court, and the General Council, we think that their import and meaning is that,
subject to the restrictions laid down in the regulations, women shall be allowed not
merely to qualify themselves for the ordinary professional examinations with a view
to obtain a medical degree in the University, but also, when so qualified, to be admitted
to these examinations. We are, therefore, of opinion that it is the duty of
the Medical Faculty to admit them to examination accordingly.</p>

<p>“<i>Query</i> 2.&mdash;If this was not involved, is it in the power of the Senatus, either alone
or in conjunction with the University Court, to accord the required permission to
admit them to professional examination with a view to graduation?</p>

<p>“<i>Opinion.</i>&mdash;Upon the ground of keeping faith with the women who have, in reliance
upon the regulations and in compliance with the terms thereby prescribed, qualified
themselves for professional examination with a view to graduation, we are of opinion
that the Senatus is entitled to direct that they shall be admitted to examination;
and we also think that, without any further direction or authority than the regulations
necessarily imply, the Medical Faculty is entitled to admit them to examination.</p>

<p>“<i>Queries</i> 3 and 4.&mdash;Is it competent for the Senatus, either directly or in conjunction
with the other University authorities, to appoint special lecturers to deliver
qualifying courses of lectures to women who are matriculated and registered students
of medicine, when such instruction cannot be obtained from the professors of the
special subjects in question? Is it competent for the Senatus or other University
authorities so far to relax the ordinary regulations with respect to extra-mural
classes as to authorise women to attend outside the University those courses of lectures
which are denied to them by the Professors within the walls, such courses
being held to qualify for graduation beyond the number of <em>four</em>, as contemplated in
the present regulations?</p>

<p>“<i>Opinion.</i>&mdash;If the existing regulations with respect to graduation in medicine stand
upon statutes passed by the University Commissioners, whose powers have now expired,
it is competent for the University Court to alter them with the written consent
of the Chancellor and with the approval of Her Majesty in Council. This is provided
by section 19 of the Act of 1858. If they stand on the authority of the Court, or of
any other power in the University itself, we should think that they may be altered
by the University Court under section 12 of the Act, ‘after due communication with
the Senatus Academicus, and with the sanction of the Chancellor,’ but with the
proviso that the proposed alteration ‘shall be submitted to the University Council
for their consideration.’ In one or other of these ways it appears to us that any provision
which may be deemed necessary, or proper and reasonable, for enabling
women to complete their medical studies, with a view to graduation, maybe made.”</p>

<p>“<i>Query</i> 5.&mdash;Whether the Senatus, University Court, University Council and
Chancellor, had collectively the power of granting to women the permission to
matriculate as students as they did in 1869, and whether the regulations issued officially
(November 12, 1869) are valid as regards such matriculation?</p>

<p>“<i>Opinion.</i>&mdash;We are of opinion that the University Court, in virtue of the
powers conferred upon it by the 12th section (2) of the Act 1858, have power, after
communication with the Senatus, and with the sanction of the Chancellor, and after
the University Council have considered the subject, to grant permission to women
(as they did in 1869) to matriculate as students, and the resolutions of the Court in
that year are valid.</p>

<p>“<i>Query</i> 6.&mdash;Whether the medical Professors are exonerated from obligation to
teach, in some way or other, all matriculated students, by the fact, that, in clause 3
of the regulations quoted above, it is merely stated that they ‘shall be permitted to
have separate classes for women?’</p>

<p>“<i>Opinion.</i>&mdash;The University Court having statutory powers to ‘effect’ improvements
in the ‘internal arrangements of the University,’ and it being within
their power, under this enactment, to allow women to be educated at the University,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>we are of opinion that this resolution must be carried out in good faith and
obeyed by the Professors. The third resolution of the University Court of November
1869, which ‘<em>permits</em>’ the Professors to have separate classes for women, in no
way derogates from the resolution of the Court that women ‘shall be admitted to the
study of medicine.’</p>

<p>“<i>Query</i> 7.&mdash;In case such women as are matriculated students of medicine in the
University are refused instruction by the individual medical Professors, what is
their legal mode of redress, and against whom should it be directed?</p>

<p>“<i>Opinion.</i>&mdash;We are of opinion that the University Court can compel, by action,
the medical Professors to obey the resolutions of November, 1869, by holding separate
classes for the education of women. With respect to the title of the women, we think
that those of them who have matriculated and passed the preliminary examinations
have a title, and may enforce their rights by action. The proper form of action is,
we think, a declarator against the Professors refusing to obey the resolution of the
University Court, with petitory conclusions to the effect that they should be ordained
to hold separate classes for the instruction of the pursuers, they receiving their due
remuneration.</p>

<p>“<i>Query</i> 8.&mdash;Whether, in the first constitution or charter of the University, or in
any of the subsequent statutes, there is anything which limits the benefits of the University
to male students.</p>

<p>“<i>Opinion.</i>&mdash;The Charter of Erection and Confirmation of the ‘College of Edinburgh’
by King James <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>, dated 14th April, 1582, granted certain lands and revenues to the
Magistrates and Town Council of Edinburgh, with a license to employ those revenues,
and such others as well-disposed persons might bestow on them, in the erecting of
suitable buildings for the use of professors and ‘scholars’ of grammar, humanity, and
languages, philosophy, theology, medicine, and laws, and other liberal sciences. The
King, by this charter (as interpreted by decision of the Courts), delegated to, or conferred
upon, the magistrates and Town Council the character of patron and founder of
this new seminary of education. The powers of superintendence and control thus
conferred upon the Magistrates and Council remained with them till the Act of
1858 was passed, by which the more important powers were transferred to the University
Court. The Magistrates and Council never conferred upon the College any
independent constitution, so as to enable the members of it to exercise any power of
internal government. As founders, patrons, and delegates intrusted by the royal
grant, the Magistrates and Council remained in the full right of management, regulation,
and tutelage of their own institution.</p>

<p>“An Act of Parliament was passed in 1621 (c. 79), which may be considered as the
charter of erection of the University. It narrates the charter of 1582, and the licence
thereby given to found a College and choose Professors, and sets forth the King’s zeal
for the growth of learning, and his purpose to grant the College all immunities enjoyed
by other colleges. The statute then confirms the erection of the College, and
ratifies all the mortifications made to the town by the King or others towards its
support. It bestows on the College the name of ‘King James’ College,’ and grants to
the Magistrates ‘in favour of the said burgh of Edinburgh, patrons of the said College,
and of the College, and of rectors, regents, bursars, and <em>students</em> within the same, all
liberties, freedoms, immunities, and privileges pertaining to a free College, and that
in as ample a form and large manner as any College has or bruickis within His
Majesty’s realm.’</p>

<p>“The statute concludes with ordaining a new charter to issue, if need be, for
erecting the College, with all such privileges and immunities. No such charter was
ever issued; but the statute itself may be held equivalent to a charter. It was a
charter in favour of the Magistrates and Council as founders and patrons, and in no
way prejudiced, but on the contrary confirmed their power of superintendence, control,
and regulation of all matters concerning the internal government of the
University.</p>

<p>“We are of opinion that, in virtue of the powers they thus possessed, the Magistrates
and Town Council could at any time, during their 266 years of University rule,
have done what the University Court did in 1869&mdash;grant permission to women to be
educated at the University.</p>

<p>“On examining the records, we find that the superintendence of the patrons was
active and constant. They made, at various times during the two centuries and a half
while their jurisdiction lasted, sets of laws and regulations for the College, which
embrace all things connected with the duties and rights of professors and students,
the series and order of studies, the days and hours of lecture, the books to be read, the
conduct of students in and out of College hours, the modes of trial and graduation,
the attendance of the professors at their classes, attendance at church, dress to be
worn by students, fees to be paid, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
“All these regulations proceed on the footing that only male students attended
the University; many of them were inapplicable to females, and we cannot find any
trace of its being contemplated by the patrons that females might be students. And
we do not find any evidence of a female having attended the University.</p>

<p>“Therefore, while we are of opinion that the Magistrates and Council had the
power to pass a regulation authorising the attendance of women at the University,
and to compel the professors to teach them, yet as they never passed any such regulation,
no women could have insisted upon admission to University education as a legal
right prior to 1869.</p>

<p>“The University Court, by <abbr title="section">sec.</abbr> 12 (2), are now vested with all the powers of internal
management and regulation formerly possessed by the Magistrates and Council;
they have done what the latter never did, although they lawfully might. They have,
by their resolution of November 1869, given to women the right to demand, equally
with male students, admission to the University.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The extraordinary history of the vicissitudes endured by the lady students seems
at last to have reached its most extraordinary phase. It appears, as stated in our
columns of yesterday, that on Saturday last the Medical Faculty of the University of
Edinburgh&mdash;a body which, collectively, forms one of the law-makers of the College&mdash;passed
a vote by a majority whereby they instructed their Dean deliberately to break
a law of the University, or rather expressly ‘interdicted’ him from complying with it.
What makes the matter the more remarkable is that this special law was in the first
instance inaugurated by themselves, and subsequently approved by the Senatus and
other authorities, and incorporated in the official regulations published in the ‘Calendar.’ ...
It would seem clear enough that a decision which had been deliberately confirmed
by each university authority successively, and which had thus become law,
could not be disturbed by any one except after an equally formal process of revocation.
It is, however, well known that, though all the bodies enumerated passed the above
regulations by a majority, there was in most cases a dissatisfied minority, who wished
that all privileges should be withheld from the lady students. It would have surprised
no one to hear that a formal attempt had been made to obtain the withdrawal of the
privileges conferred; but the public were probably sufficiently astonished to learn
yesterday that, though no such open and honourable attempt had been made, a secret
<i>coup d’état</i> was planned, by which it was apparently hoped, at the very last moment,
when no appeal to the Senatus, or other authorities was possible, to crush the hopes of
the medical ladies, at least for the present year. At the Faculty meeting to which we
have referred, a vote was actually passed to ‘interdict’ the Dean, whose friendliness to
the ladies was well known, from giving to any women who were about to join the medical
class the papers necessary to enable them to pass the preliminary examination in
Arts, which is indispensable before registration&mdash;this examination having been not
only previously allowed, but actually passed by numerous ladies on no less than four
occasions! At this same notable meeting, a vote was also passed that the Medical
Faculty should disregard alike their own previous resolutions, the official regulations
of the ‘Calendar,’ and the tickets of admission already paid for and obtained by those
other ladies who are now ready to proceed to their first professional examination; and,
accordingly, a letter was sent to each of these three ladies, informing them that their
tickets had been granted ‘in error,’ and that they could not be examined ‘without the
sanction of the Senatus Academicus,’ as if that sanction had not been already given in
the most emphatic manner!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span></p>

<p>“The story is not a pleasant one. That a minority, obliged to acquiesce in an act
of liberality on the part of the majority, should, when unable to prevail by fair means,
endeavour to compass their end by a side-wind and in an underhand manner, is sufficiently
discreditable; but that, rather than relinquish their own dogged resolution to
obstruct the ladies, these Professors should deliberately abstain from all previous
warning of the means they intended to employ&mdash;should allow many months of severe
study to be passed with a definite aim and hope, and should then silently dig a pitfall
at the very threshold of the door through which the ladies must pass, and hope, by
an arbitrary exercise of authority against a few wholly unprepared women, completely
to destroy their prospects, for the present year at least&mdash;is something almost too monstrous
to be believed, did the circumstances admit of any doubt in the matter.
Whether these medical gentlemen really supposed that, by their unsupported fiat, they
could set aside all the existing regulations of the University, or whether they trusted to
the ladies’ want of knowledge in legal matters not to challenge their authority, it is of
course impossible to say, but one would rather believe in the ignorance of law implied
by the former alternative, than in the lamentable want of honourable feeling that
would be conveyed in the latter. Be this as it may, it is not easy to exaggerate the
damaging effect that a story of this kind is likely to have on the minds of the public.
That such a line of conduct <em>could</em> be planned and carried out by a body of men claiming
the name of gentlemen, and belonging to a profession that calls itself ‘liberal’ and
‘learned,’ is perhaps as striking a proof as could be given of the fatally blinding influence
of professional prejudice and unreasoning trades-unionism.”</p>

<p class="notes_ref"><cite>Scotsman</cite>, <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 20, 1872.</p>

<p class="new_quote">“We confess that the conduct of the medical faculty amazes us. Can they suppose
that such obstructions are calculated to stop the movement? Why should they
not show a little practical sense, and choose their fighting-ground with reasonable
judgment? A single Professor, whose classes must be attended according to present
regulations, might have hoped successfully to resist the demand that he should teach
mixed classes. There are many people who do not look with particular complacency
upon the efforts of a few ladies to obtain a place in the medical profession; but paltry
persecutions like these, and little dodges sprung upon them suddenly, will assuredly
turn the popular tide in their favour. The medical profession seem to
think that they have only got to get behind these too devoted students, and shout
‘bo!’ loud enough to frighten them out of their five wits. They might surely have
known Miss Jex-Blake better by this time. Are the Edinburgh Medical Faculty
really afraid of the competition of the ladies? Do they look upon them as ‘knobsticks,’
against whom the doors must be closed in spite of law, reason, and liberty?
They are welcome to their fears&mdash;narrow as they are&mdash;and to their opinions on the
question of lady doctors; but we trust that the University of Edinburgh will see that
its regulations are maintained. Having given permission to females to study medicine
under conditions which are strict enough, and even somewhat hard, the University
must prevent any combination of Professors from taking the matter into their
own hands, and debarring the ladies from the privileges for which they have so
gallantly fought. In the meantime, we congratulate the five ladies on the prompt
spirit in which they have repelled the insidious attempt of a majority of the medical
faculty&mdash;we believe only a very small majority&mdash;to cut their studies short. We need
not urge them to persevere, for they seem to have that ‘faculty’ in predominance,
but we think we can assure them that every victory that they gain, and every defeat
that they suffer, adds to the number of their sympathisers, and breaks down no inconsiderable
portion of the mountain of prejudice that they had to face when they
commenced their career as students. If the Medical Professors want to defeat them,
they must get better advisers, and not court humiliation. Their present counsellor
is like Adversity, ugly and venomous in appearance only. Without the ‘precious
jewel,’ the treasure of ill-judged and unreasonable persecutions, which he carries in
his head, the little forlorn hope of courageous ladies, whose ranks are thinned
from time to time by marriage and other maladies, would hardly be so likely to plant
their triumphant flag on the top of the Castle rock at last.”</p>

<p>This correspondence is so remarkable that I subjoin it entire.</p>

<blockquote>

<h4 title="" class="note_heading">(1) <i>To the University Court.</i></h4>

<p class="notes_place_date">“15 Buccleuch Place, November 21, 1871.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;It is now two years since you passed a series of resolutions, dated
12th November 1869, to the effect that ‘women shall be admitted to the study of
medicine in the University.’</p>

<p>“In the time that has since elapsed, I and those ladies who matriculated with me
at that date, have completed one-half of the studies necessary for graduation in the
University of Edinburgh. Nearly five months ago, I ventured to point out to the
Senatus Academicus that, unless further arrangements were made, it would be impossible
for us to complete the studies which we have begun with your express
sanction. After pointing out the existing difficulties, I ventured further to make
two suggestions, either of which, if adopted, might enable us to complete our education
in the University. In reply, however, I was informed that the Senatus, ‘having
taken the opinion of counsel with reference to the proposals contained in the memorial
of date 26th June 1871, find themselves unable to comply with either of those
proposals.’</p>

<p>“I understand, however, that since the date referred to, another legal opinion has
been obtained from the Lord Advocate and Sheriff Fraser, and has been laid before
the Senatus, and by them forwarded to your honourable Court. As, however, the
Senatus still appear unwilling to initiate any measure by which we may be relieved
from our present difficulties, I feel constrained now to appeal to you, in my own
name and that of my fellow-students, to take such action as shall enable us to
complete our studies.</p>

<p>“I beg to represent to you that we have all paid matriculation fees for the
present year, and are by our tickets declared to be ‘Cives Academiæ Edinensis,’ and
that yet we, who commenced our studies in 1869, are unable during the present
session to obtain any further classes whatever towards completing our required course
of study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span></p>

<p>“We understand from those friends who have taken legal opinion on the subject&mdash;and
doubtless such opinion will be laid before you simultaneously with this letter&mdash;that
we are entitled to demand from the University the means of completing our
studies, and that, failing any other alternative measures, we can claim the instruction
of the Medical Professors to the extent needed to complete our curriculum.</p>

<p>“We beg, therefore, most respectfully to request that, unless any other mode of
supplying our needs seems preferable to you, you will vouchsafe to ordain that the
Professors, whose courses we are bound by the University regulations to attend,
shall give us the requisite instruction.&mdash;I beg to subscribe myself, Gentlemen, your
obedient servant,</p>

<p class="notes_sig"><span class="smcap">“Sophia Jex-Blake</span>.”</p>

<h4 title="" class="note_heading">(2.) <i>Minute of University Court of January 8, 1872.</i></h4>

<p>“The University Court have had under consideration the letters of Miss Jex-Blake
and Miss Louisa Stevenson, of 21st November, 1871, and other relative documents
laid before them on behalf of the women who have been admitted by the regulations
of the Court of November 10th, 1869, to study medicine in the University.</p>

<p>“In these papers it is stated that certain Professors of the Faculty of Medicine
have declined to give separate classes of instruction to women; and the Court are
asked either (1) to extend, in the case of female medical students, the privilege granted
by ordinance by the Universities’ Commissioners, to lecturers, not being Professors in a
university, of qualifying for graduation by their lectures, which privilege is now restricted
to four of the prescribed subjects of study; or (2) To authorise the appointment
of special lecturers to give, in the University, qualifying courses of instruction
in place of those Professors who decline to do so; or (3.) To ordain that the Professors
referred to shall themselves give the necessary courses of instruction to women.</p>

<p>“The second course suggested it is not in the power of the Court, or other University
authorities, singly or jointly to adopt.</p>

<p>“The third course is equally beyond the power of the Court. The Act of 1858 vests
in the Court plenary powers to deal with any Professor who shall fail to discharge his
duties, but no Professor can be compelled to give courses of instruction other than those
which, by the use and wont of the University, it has been the duty of the holders of
his chair to deliver.</p>

<p>“The first of the proposed measures would imply an alteration in one of the
ordinances for graduation in medicine (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 8, clause <abbr title="6">vi.</abbr>, 4). Such alteration could be
made by the University Court only with the consent, expressed in writing, of the
Chancellor, and with the approval of Her Majesty in Council.</p>

<p>“But to alter, in favour of female students, rules laid down for the regulation of
graduation in medicine would imply an assumption on the part of the Court, that
the University of Edinburgh has the power of granting degrees to women. It seems
to the Court impossible to them to assume the existence of a power that is questioned
in many quarters, and which is both affirmed and denied by eminent counsel. So long
as these doubts remain, it would, in the opinion of the Court, be premature to consider
the expediency of taking steps to obtain, in favour of female students, an alteration
of an ordinance which may be held not to apply to women.</p>

<p>“Though the Court are unable to comply with any of the specific requests referred
to, they are at the same time desirous to remove, so far as possible, any present
obstacle in the way of a complete medical education being given to women,&mdash;provided
always that medical instruction to women be imparted in strictly separate classes.</p>

<p>“The Court are of opinion that the question under reference has been complicated
by the introduction of the subject of graduation, which is not essential to the completion
of a medical or other education. The University of London, which has a
special charter for the examination of women, does not confer degrees upon women,
but only grants them ‘certificates of proficiency.’ If the applicants in the present
case would be content to seek the examination of women by the University for certificates
of proficiency in medicine, instead of University degrees, the Court believe
that arrangements for accomplishing this object would fall within the scope of the
powers given to them by section 12 of the Universities’ (Scotland) Act. The Court
would be willing to consider any such arrangements which might be submitted to
them.”</p>

<h4 title="" class="note_heading">(3.) <i>To the University Court.</i></h4>

<p class="notes_place_date">“15 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh, January 18, 1872.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I have received from your Secretary a copy of your minute of the
8th instant, and I beg you to allow me most respectfully, but at the same time most
emphatically, to protest against the decision therein contained, on the following
grounds:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span></p>

<p>“1. That when women were admitted to study ‘for the profession of medicine’ in
the University of Edinburgh, and were required to pay the ordinary matriculation
fees as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cives Academiæ Edinensis</i>, in addition to those for instruction, it was believed
to be involved that, subject only to the restrictions laid down in the regulations of
November 12, 1869, we should be allowed to complete our education, and should, as a
matter of course, proceed to the degree of M.D., no official intimation to the contrary
being given to us at the time, nor indeed until now, when we have half completed our
University curriculum. You will allow me to remind you further, that we have very
high legal authority for believing that these expectations were well founded, and that
matriculation does involve necessarily all the privileges of studentship, including
graduation, as was indeed recently admitted by a legal Professor, who has always
been one of our most determined opponents, when addressing your honourable Court
in favour of rescinding the present regulations.</p>

<p>“2. That, except with a view to ultimate graduation, it was quite meaningless to
require us to pass, as we did, the preliminary examination in Arts, which has not any
necessary connection with the study of medicine itself, but is expressly stated to be
‘the first examination <em>for the medical degree</em>.’</p>

<p>“3. That we have all along pursued our studies with a view to the further professional
examinations; that, in the resolutions passed by the Medical Faculty on July
1, 1869, it was distinctly stated that ‘ladies be allowed to attend medical classes and
to receive certificates of attendance qualifying for examination;’ that, further, on
April 9, 1870, the Senatus Academicus expressly ordained that exactly the same University
certificates of attendance should be issued to students of both sexes, for the
special purpose of qualifying for professional examination.</p>

<p>“4. That no kind of official notice was ever given to us that a doubt existed respecting
our admission to the ordinary professional examinations, until certain of our
number had completed their preparations for the first professional examination, and
had paid their fees for, and received tickets of admission to, the same; and that,
when the matter was brought before the Senatus, it was by them decided that ladies
should be admitted to the examination, and accordingly the ladies in question were
examined in the ordinary course and passed the examination successfully.</p>

<p>“5. That under the existing Act of Parliament it is impossible for any person to
practise medicine under legal sanction, without a distinct ‘qualification’ as defined
by the said Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>“6. That the only ‘qualification’ which it is in the power of the University of Edinburgh
to grant, is the ordinary medical degree, and that no ‘certificates of proficiency’
would possess the slightest legal value unless a special Act of Parliament was passed
making such certificates registrable qualifications.</p>

<p>“7. That the difficulty and expense of procuring such a special Act of Parliament
would be very much greater than that of obtaining the sanction of the Queen in Council
to such minor alterations in the University Ordinances as are alone necessary to enable
us to complete our education by means of additional extra-mural classes; even if
your honourable Court declines to make the necessary arrangements <em>within</em> the
University.</p>

<p>“8. That we are informed on high authority that it is at present within the
power of your honourable Court, in conjunction with the Senatus, to make the
necessary arrangements within the University, without any external sanction;
either by ordaining that the present Professors shall instruct women in separate
classes, or by appointing special lecturers for that purpose. As regards the former
course, I venture to remark that several Professors in the Faculty of Arts are already
delivering two or more lectures daily, and that, as I presume it was always contemplated
that each Professor should instruct all matriculated students desiring to
study his subject, it is quite conceivable that it might become necessary from the
number of students, or otherwise, for the medical Professors also to be required to
deliver two courses; and that, therefore, it could hardly be considered a hardship if
they should be required to deliver a second course, with proper remuneration for the
same, to those matriculated students who are forbidden by the University to attend
in the ordinary classes. As regards the second alternative, I believe that it has
never been doubted that the Senatus and University Court, conjointly, have the
power of appointing any number of assistants or special lecturers in any faculty, if
they are required for the efficient performance of the teaching of the University.</p>

<p>“9. That as the main difficulty before your honourable Court seems to be that
regarding graduation, with which we are not immediately concerned at this moment,
we are quite willing to rest our claims to ultimate graduation on the facts as they
stand up to the present date, and in case your honourable Court will now make
arrangements whereby we can continue our education, we will undertake not to
draw any arguments in favour of our right to graduation from such future arrangements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>so that they may at least be made without prejudice to the present legal
position of the University.</p>

<p>“10. That we are informed by high legal authorities that we are entitled, as
matriculated students, to demand from the University complete arrangements for
our instruction, and that we are further entitled to bring an action of declarator to
obtain the same from the several Professors if no alternative measures are devised,
and that we shall inevitably be driven to pursue this course, with whatever reluctance,
if your honourable Court persistently refuses to make, in any form whatever, such
arrangements as may enable us to complete our education, and to obtain a legal
qualification to practise.</p>

<p>“Earnestly commending the above considerations to your most favourable notice,
I have the honour, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,</p>

<p class="notes_sig">“<span class="smcap">Sophia Jex-Blake.</span>”</p>

<h4 title="" class="note_heading">(4.) <i>From the Secretary of the University Court.</i></h4>

<p class="notes_place_date">“University of Edinburgh, 5th February 1872.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;I am desired by the University Court to inform you that your letter,
dated the 18th ultimo, has been laid before them and considered.</p>

<p>“In reply, I am to say that in several points of your view of the past history and
present position of the question relative to the medical education of women in Edinburgh
the Court are unable to concur.</p>

<p>“Without going into the discussions which might be raised on these points, it
appears to the Court that it is only necessary for them to enter upon the subject of
your ninth paragraph, in which you say:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘That as the main difficulty before your honourable Court seems to be that regarding
graduation, with which we are not immediately concerned at this moment,
we are quite willing to rest our claims to ultimate graduation on the facts as they
stand up to the present date; and in case your honourable Court will now make
arrangements whereby we can continue our education, we will undertake not to draw
any arguments in favour of our right to graduation from such future arrangements,
so that they may at least be made without prejudice to the present legal position of
the University.’</p>

<p>“On this I am desired to inform you that you appear to ask no more than was
offered by the Court in their resolution of the 8th ultimo, in which it was stated that
while the Court were restrained by legal doubts as to the power of the University to
grant degrees to women, from considering ‘the expediency of taking steps to obtain,
in favour of female students, an alteration of an ordinance which might be held not
to apply to women,’ they were, ‘at the same time, desirous to remove, so far as possible,
any present obstacle in the way of a complete medical education being given to
women: provided always that medical instruction to women be imparted in strictly
separate classes.’</p>

<p>“On the assumption, therefore, that while you at present decline the offer made
by the Court with reference to certificates of proficiency, you now ask merely that
arrangements should be made for completing the medical education of yourself and
the other ladies on behalf of whom you write, I am to state that the Court are quite
ready to meet your views. If, therefore, the names of extra-academical teachers of
the required medical subjects be submitted by yourself, or by the Senatus, the Court
will be prepared to consider the respective fitness of the persons so named to be
authorised to hold medical classes for women who have in this or former sessions been
matriculated students of the University, and also the conditions and regulations under
which such classes should be held.</p>

<p>“It is, however, to be distinctly understood that such arrangements are not to be
founded on as implying any right in women to obtain medical degrees, or as conferring
any such right upon the students referred to.</p>

<p class="notes_place_date">“15 Buccleuch Place, February 9, 1872.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I beg to thank you sincerely for the resolution to which you
came on Monday the 5th <abbr title="instant">inst.</abbr>, and which, if I understand it rightly, will, I trust,
prove a satisfactory solution of our present difficulties.</p>

<p>“We will, if you wish it, very gladly prepare and submit to your honourable
Court a list of extra-academical lecturers and of gentlemen prepared to qualify as
such, who may, with your sanction, instruct us in the various subjects which we
have to study; but before doing so, I venture to beg for official confirmation of my
interpretation of your late resolution in two essential particulars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span></p>

<p>“1. That though you at present give us no pledge respecting our ultimate graduation,
it is your intention to consider the proposed extra-mural courses as ‘qualifying’
for graduation, and that you will take such measures as may be necessary to secure
that they will be accepted if it is subsequently determined that the University has
the power of granting degrees to women.</p>

<p>“2. That we shall be admitted in due course to the ordinary professional examinations
on presentation of the proper certificates of attendance on the said extra-mural
classes.</p>

<p>“You will, I am sure, understand that, while we are quite willing to accept present
arrangements for instruction without any pledge that they will confer a right to
graduation, it would be useless for us to attend any classes which would be incapable
of qualifying for graduation, and impossible for us to acquiesce in any agreement
which might prejudice the claim which we believe ourselves to possess to the ultimate
attainment of the medical degree.</p>

graduation, it is your intention to consider the proposed extra-mural courses
as ‘qualifying’ for graduation, and that you will take such measures as
may be necessary to secure that they will be so accepted, if it is subsequently
determined that the University has the power of granting degrees
to women.</p>

<p>“‘<abbr title="2">II.</abbr> That we shall be admitted in due course to the ordinary professional examinations
on presentation of the proper certificates of attendance on the
said extra-mural classes.’</p>

<p>“In reply, I am desired to point out that no extra-mural courses, beyond the
number of four allowed by the Ordinance of the Universities Commissioners, could
either qualify for graduation, or for the ordinary professional examinations, except
under a change in the ordinance; which change could be made only by a resolution
of the Court sanctioned by the Chancellor, and approved by the Queen in Council.</p>

<p>“The Court have already declared, in their resolution of the 8th of January last,
that they cannot even enter on the consideration of the expediency of such a change
in the ordinance until the legality of female graduation has been determined.</p>

<p>“It would not only be premature for the Court to express at present any views or
intentions on the points to which you refer, but it would be clearly contrary to their
duty to do so. For, supposing the legal question to be decided in a way favourable
to your wishes, those points would then doubtless be referred to the Court for their
decision, when various parties would probably desire to be heard with regard to them.</p>

<p>“I am to add that in your letter of the 18th January, you appeared merely to ask
that the Court ‘will now make arrangements whereby we can continue our education,’
and that the Court offered, as stated in my letter of the 5th <abbr title="instant">inst.</abbr>, to meet your views
in the only way which appeared to lie within their competency. The Court are still
of opinion that it is quite impossible for them at present to add anything to that
offer.”</p>

<p>I am anxious to guard myself from being supposed to attribute to Scotch nationality
the exceptionally bad conduct of certain students in Edinburgh, during 1870&ndash;71.
I cannot but hope that such behaviour as I have described would have been impossible
in any English Medical School, but, in so saying, I do not by any means wish to
imply that Scotch students have less good feeling than others, when their superiors
set them an example of courtesy. In point of fact, moreover, some of those who
took most pains to make themselves obnoxious were not Scotchmen at all, but Englishmen
of an extremely low class. Some Scotch lads no doubt behaved very badly,
but, on the other hand, the guard of honour (see page 104) was almost wholly composed
of Scotch and Irish students, who showed the utmost indignation at the conduct
of the rioters.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
